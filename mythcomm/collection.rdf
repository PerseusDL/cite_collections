        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">The Homeric Hymn to Dionysus is a depiction of the powerful yet contradicting abilities that the God Dionysus possesses. Dionysus is the god of everything and its opposite, and he reveals these conflicting powers after being picked up from the “fruitless sea” by the “black ship”. Dionysus exemplifies these contradicting powers by being able to transform between mere mortal and god. While standing on the “fruitless sea”, Dionysus appears to be nothing more than a stranded man. However, when he is on the deck of the black ship the helmsman and crew realize that he does posses divine powers like those of Zeus, Apollo, or Poseidon. The master of the ship fails to realize the divinity which ultimately served as a fatal mistake. Dionysus shows his contradictory reputation in this situation by showing compassion for those who accept him while showing vengeful hate on to those who do not recognize his divinity. Along with being contradictory, Dionysus has a close connection with nature. We see this from the very beginning while he is standing on the “fruitless sea&quot; which gives the audience a visual of the natural connection. Dionysus’ close connection with nature extends when he is on the deck of the vessel. While not everyone on the vessel is convinced that he possesses divine powers, he flows waves of red wine and rows of vines throughout the deck of the ship along with a pleasant smell in the air, further suggesting his connection with nature. To reinforce his divinity to the members on board the vessel, Dionysus transforms himself into a fierce, mutilating lion while also creating a massive and lethal bear to cause havoc on the deck. This contributes to his connection with nature while also connecting back to his image of being the god of everything and its contrary. Dionysus shows compassion to those who recognized his divine powers and spared their lives, transforming them into dolphins, which were honorable animals in the ancient world. He also shows no compassion to the captain who failed to accept his divinity and mutilates his body. The Homeric Hymn to Dionysus is proof that Dionysus is the son of Zeus and Semele, and that he is a powerful god. Also, it proves that Dionysus represents everything and its opposite by being a mortal and an immortal and a forgiver and an avenger. This hymn also shows his connection with the natural world the flowing of wine and vines and transformation from man to animal.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">In this passage, comic playwright Aristophanes parodies Hesiod’s Theogony by making a series of bizarre changes and additions to the genealogy that the ancient Greek audience would be familiar with. First, he creates an unlikely situation where birds, instead of deities talk down to humans. To add to the humor, the birds are there to tell the audience that humans are part of a weak and an unfortunate race that lives a dark life. Aristophanes increases the severity of the humans’ situation by juxtaposing it with that of the birds, which is characterized by immortality, ethereality and youth. The Greek audience may indeed acknowledge the humans’ inferiority as reality since they believed in their own mythologies, which portray humans as beings of low status. Thus, the kind of humor here is possibly a laugh-at-life humor, where people laugh at their own helplessness to bring relief to a situation that cannot be changed.
The next comedic change that Aristophanes introduces is the order of the primordial deities. While Hesiod tells us that Eros came before Night, Aristophanes tells us that it is the reverse. The comic playwright is perhaps relying on the common understanding that nighttime implies sexual activities to poke fun at the fact that there cannot be Eros or love without the Night. The swap is also befitting since Aristophanes must create a setting in which the birds’ status can be raised. Night is created first because it represents the sky, a physically high position where the gods and birds live. Eros then springs from an egg, appropriate since he is the creator of birds. To show their superior lineage, the birds continuously boast about how their progenitors have wings like them. The emphasis on wings as proof of superior lineage is used to demonstrate the ridiculous logic of the birds and therefore create humor.
Lastly, Aristophanes has the birds speak of the extent of their knowledge and power in an exaggerated manner to make this passage comical. When the birds talk about how much humans will know about the gods after listening to the birds, they claim that even the philosopher Prodicus will envy that knowledge. This cultural reference is funny because Prodicus is a famous philosopher respected even by Plato, so to the audience it must be absurd to think that their knowledge will surpass that of Prodicus. This parodic passage is concluded with an explicit and over the top description of the birds’ power to help lovers fulfill their sexual desires.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">The Homeric Hymn to Dionysius clearly illustrates the god’s character as the deity of basically everything and it’s opposite. Throughout the hymn we get clues about certain aspects of Dionysius, and then the inclusion of the opposite of the mentioned characteristic. For instance, at the beginning of the hymn Dionysius is “seeming like a stripling in the first flush of manhood”, showing the youth of the god. However, throughout the work you get a sense that the god is in fact older and more mature than the description of his looks suggests, such as his “strong shoulders” and the calm he maintains while the pirates attempt to bind him. Dionysius appears to these pirates in the form of a mortal, but at the same time is dressed lavishly in a purple robe as a king or god would wear, portraying him as both mortal and divine, an essential aspect of Dionysius’ character in many of the myths about him. When the binds continue to fall off the god, only one man realizes that the crew is dealing with a god and for this is labeled a “Madman”. This idea of madness ties in perfectly in the case of Dionysius because it is an integral part of his character considering he is often associated with wine and drinking. The madness that overcomes a drunken person is said to be the god temporarily inhabiting the soul of the mortal, something a mere mortal cannot handle. In this case, however, the “Madman” is the only one seeing the situation clearly. When Dionysius inevitably shows his true power as a god, he wholly and savagely destroys the heretical crew members, sparing only the one believing “Madman”. Once again, the opposing aspects of Dionysius’ character come out, showing how savage he can be but also merciful when someone wins his favor, lending to his epithet of “Liberator” (which also explains why the bonds would not hold him). In its entirety, this Homeric Hymn to Dionysius perfectly describes the ironic and wholly indefinable nature of the god Dionysius.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">In Sophocles&apos; play *Antigone* lines 450-470 describe a verbal altercation between Oedipus&apos; daughter Antigone and Creon, the acting ruler of Thebes. Creon is punishing Antigone for attempting to bury her brother, which is against Creon&apos;s laws. Creon&apos;s tyrannical behavior represents the archetype of hubris, which ultimately leads to his downfall. During his time as King of Thebes, Creon enacts laws designed to humiliate the family of Polynices. Creon&apos;s law against burial is a blatant violation of Themis. It is proper decorum in war to allow fallen foes to be properly buried. For Antigone&apos;s brother to &quot;lie in death lie an unburied corpse&quot; (467) is a deep taboo for the ancient Greeks. It is a crime against the Gods, because the Gods laws of burial are &quot;but for all time, and no man knows when they were first put forth.&quot; (457) The natural laws concerning life and death are not meant to be trifled with by a tyrant. Antigone describes her willingness to break Creon&apos;s laws, saying that she did not believe that &quot;decrees were of such force, that a mortal could override the unwritten and unfailing statutes given us by the gods.&quot; (454-456) Creon has placed his own laws and his own pride above the law. Antigone has no fear of tyrannical action, saying &quot;not for fear of any man&apos;s pride was I about to owe a penalty to the gods for breaking these [laws].&quot; (459-460) By placing his own pride above the will and decree of the Gods, Creon is committing the ultimate crime of hubris. Antigone knows this, calling Creon a fool for deeming the wishes and laws of the Olympian gods to be folly. In doing so, Creon put himself above the Gods, which is the definition of hubris. Ultimately, Creon&apos;s pride leads to his downfall, as his tyrannical rule ends when Lycus takes over Thebes. In Greek mythology, hubris always results in the demise of those who commit it. By denying the laws of the Gods in favor of his pride, Creon sealed his fate as perpetrator of hubris.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">The drinking of wine and the Dionysian cult was an integral part of Ancient Greek culture. These kylikes and zone cup would be present at a Greek symposium, an elite male drinking party for socializing and honoring Dionysus. Since a central aspect of a symposium was the preparation and drinking of wine, a kylix, or the ancient Greek equivalent of a wine glass, would be of paramount importance. Kylikes would be prominent objects at symposia, allowing elite men to recount the stories or myths depicted on them, showing off their cultural knowledge. Since the elite intellect was so connected to the images on the drinking vessels, the iconography on these vessels served a functional purpose in spurring conversation. On the zone cup, the imagery relating to symposia is explicit; men are seen reclining, playing music and engaging in discussion, which very well may have centered on the mythic imagery on their drinking vessels. The same cup shows an interaction between Dionysus and Hercules. Dionysus induced enthousiasmos in his drunken followers, causing them to act crazy because of the human body inability of dealing with contact from the gods—somewhat paralleling Hercules’ perpetually out of control and ridiculous strength due to his half-divine lineage. Hercules’ over the top behavior comes from his overpowering physical strength, while Dionysus’ was attributed to his overwhelming spiritual potency. This spirit manifested itself in his worshippers intoxication through the drinking of wine, which was also sometimes called Dionysus, furthering the notion that during worship the god inhabited the body of his celebrants, causing their insanity. Hercules also often drank heavily and mirrored Dionysian recklessness at times. His gluttony, use of a club, and sexual potency, made him seem brutish and unrefined—just like the Dionysian satyrs and maenads in their wild orgia festivals. As pictured on the kylikes, the satyrs, with erect phalluses, are dancing and lusting after bare-footed maenads, all of which alludes to the savagery and uncivilized nature of the Dionysian cult. Having the primary worshippers in the orgia festival be women was already problematic in the heavily misogynistic Ancient Greek society, but their behavior and identification as “bacchantes,” or those who were letting go and freeing themselves of the constraints of society, was especially terrifying. Playing music, drinking, dancing, wearing pelts and snakes in their hair, and holding thyrsi in an outdoor and nocturnal setting were all part of the maenads shedding of their expected societal behavior. They would even practice sparagmos, or the ripping apart of small animals, to honor Dionysus’ dismemberment by the titans while in Hades. This ritual was seen as especially horrific because of the Greek belief that a dismembered body was unable to go on to the afterlife since it could not travel in one piece. Dionysus was able to survive this experience, echoing his identity as the god of everything and its counterpart: separate pieces living on as a whole, and uncivilized behavior allowing for the worship of a god.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">The focus on the sea goddess Thetis on this Greek plate exposes the ancient Greek’s belief in a series of divinities that embody the sea, transforming it unexpectedly according to their will. The central figure of the piece is Thetis, one of the fifty Nereids born to Nereus, an old man of the sea with the ability to shape shift. Thetis is also capable of transformation and in Book 11 of Ovid’s Metamorphoses, attempts to escape the advances of Proteus by “often changed[ing] her shape as it was known” (lines 253-255). Greek belief stated that bodies of water were all inhabited by some sort of divine entity such as a god or a nymph that embodied the spirit of the earth. As shown in the dish, Thetis and the Nereids are a central component of the spirit that personifies the ocean, including their ability to transform. In the same work, Ovid says that Thetis often went to “a firm shore, which will not retain a foot’s impression” (line 237). Ovid places Thetis and her shape shifting into the shoreline, the gateway to the ocean, saying that the land was firm, but not firm enough to hold a footprint. The typical land of Greece would have been dry, and any footprints made would have remained. However, at the shoreline is where power transitions to the divinities of the ocean, and the patterns of the ocean are as fleeting and unpredictable as the disappearing footprint itself. Past the shoreline lies the immense body of the ocean, governed by the irritable and vengeful Poseidon who, like Thetis, could transform it in any way he saw fit. To the Greeks, one of the first seafaring people of the ancient world, the ocean was an unpredictable and mysterious abyss surrounding their entire world. Storms would arise frequently and suddenly on naval excursions, seemingly caused by a god like Poseidon, transforming the ocean from a calm pleasant body to a tumultuous beast that could annihilate an entire ship. This characteristic of the god is best depicted in Homer’s Odyssey, when the crafty Odysseus manages to escape Poseidon’s son, the cyclops Polyphemus. As a result, Poseidon suddenly becomes incredibly angry with Odysseus and transforms the ocean into a stormy world of peril for Odysseus and his crew. The central power of Poseidon and, by extension, Thetis and the rest of the oceanic deities lies in their ability to transform themselves and their realm, leaving Greek mortals at their mercy. At the same time, the sea could not be avoided, as fish was a major resource for Greek sustenance, and the Greek seafarer would have to be respectful of the power of the God’s, or else face their wrath and transformation. A warning of this fact could exist in the dish with Thetis, reminding the user that their very meal depends on Thetis and the other transformative deities of the Greek ocean.

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Aristophanes’ satire Birds expresses an alternative view of the cosmology where birds attempt to show that they are superior to the human race. According to the birds, mortals are frail, weak, uneducated creatures that are “chained to the earth”(Aristoph. Birds 685). On the other hand, birds can enter the realm of Zeus and fly to the ends of the earth, areas mortals can never reach. For example, mortal souls become doves and then travel on to Hades. The birds assert that they are “immortal beings”( Aristoph. Birds 689) which is an absurd proclamation to make to humans, a species that regularly hunts and eats them. Humans have also considered birds to be the frailer and weaker species due to their smaller size and fragile wings. The birds even arrogantly declare that that they are “ethereal”(Aristoph. Birds 689), which means extremely delicate and fragile. However, they still boast that they are the superior and stronger species. The birds even claim to possess knowledge that humans can only dream of acquiring. They tell the mortals that “even Prodicus will envy you your knowledge”(Aristoph. Birds 692) after they finishing telling the humans their origins. A preposterous idea to the Greek audience for Prodicus was a famous and well-respected philosopher. In their cosmology, birds are descended from Eros, with “glittering golden wings”(Aristoph. Birds 697) and winged Chaos, and were created before the gods. The birds cite their connection to Eros through the existence of their wings and their actions towards lovers. Birds boast that they have the power to bring immortals and mortals together in love, powers that humans could only dream of. They state that their powers have “opened the thighs”(Aristoph. Birds 706) of many that “swore to remain insensible” (Aristoph. Birds 705). However, this action is not something of which the birds should be proud. The birds are being used as an object of persuasion. Therefore, humans control the birds’ fate and they are at the mercy of human decisions. The birds would also take great pride in the fact that they brought together the King of the Gods and the Goddess of Marriage. In the myth, Hera had originally refused Zeus, but Zeus won Hera’s heart by disguising himself into a small helpless bird in a middle of storm (Pausanias. 2.17.4). Hera embraced the bird, and then Zeus transformed back to his original form. While this myth appeared several hundred years after the play was written, the bird still could only unite the lovers by appearing as a weak, helpless creature that Hera felt she must protect. The idea of birds appearing as fragile and powerless creatures compared to humans has continued over the centuries, therefore highlighting the ridiculous of the birds’ assertions. Overall, Birds illustrate the birds’ self-delusional ideas of their strength and power over both mortals and immortals.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Sophocles’ *Antigone* focuses on gender roles and loyalties through the lens of Antigone as she is caught between mortal and divine law. The play explores ideals such as submissiveness, the ability to bring order to the home life and humility around one’s husband. These are qualities that are rarely displayed by Antigone who is known for her rebellious nature, status as a “bride of Hades” and independence. For example, both Antigone and Andromache (princess of Troy) face problems of lack of marital status. Because ancient society saw women as a form of property, the lack of an “owner” cause Antigone and Andromache trouble. Antigone is no longer Oedipus’ daughter as she is engaged to Haemon, but she dies before getting married making her a “bride of Hades.” Similarly, Andromache knows that when, not if, Hector dies she will become a drifting status-less concubine after Troy is ransacked. Andromache cries out, “Thou art to me father and queenly mother…brother…and my stalwart husband…have pity, and remain here on the wall, lest thou make thy child an orphan and thy wife a widow.” (Hom. *Il.* VI, 330-332.) The desperation emphasizes the Greek ideal that women need a man in their life to guide them, and the lack thereof brings nothing but strife. In addition to her undetermined status, Antigone is also conflicted with her loyalties between divine and mortal law. Instead of consulting an oracle or a priestess for clarification, she chooses to decide her fate independently—an ideal that is not respected by the Greeks. She does so in the line “Not for fear of any man&apos;s pride was I about to owe a penalty to the gods for breaking these. Die I must, that I knew well.” (Sophocles *Antigone*, 458.) Before defying Creon’s edict, Antigone could have consulted Creon regarding themis regarding the lack of burial, consulted an oracle for advice or sought asylum abroad after burial. However, Antigone’s defiant nature led to her death by live burial. Not only is she independent but her martyr/out-spoken nature emphasize that independent women are not to be respected. Antigone and Andromache’s lack of status have no positive outcome which demonstrates that the nature of an unwed woman cannot be beneficial. Furthermore, the parallels to Andromache help to show that Antigone’s unwed and rebellious/independent nature are not features that are to be respected.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Homeric Hymn to Dionysus
The Homeric Hymn to Dionysus is a brief yet telling portrayal of the vast power and grandiose nature of the god Dionysus. Dionysus, the god of being one thing and its contrary, reveals the magnificence of his power during the episode on board the “black ship.” Dionysus’s ability to transcend the boundaries between the human and divine causes the pirates to make a fatal mistake. The crew’s failure to recognize Dionysus’s divinity ultimately spells disaster for them. The hymn reveals that Dionysus is capable of exacting revenge upon those who dare to deny his divinity, yet capable of showing compassion for those who accept him as a god. From the opening lines it becomes clear that what follows is to be a study of contrasts. The hymn begins with a regal, majestic, virile Dionysus appearing by the shore of the “fruitless sea.” This imagery of a barren sea contrasts with Dionysus’ association with nature. Dionysus’s miracles, from the appearance of the vine with clusters and the growth of ivy with blossoming flowers, demonstrate his close concert with the natural world. The wine flowing throughout the ship, as well as the ambrosial odor, symbolize Dionysus’s divine nature. The vine and odor of ambrosia refer to the myth of Lycurgus who too incurred Dionysus’s rage when he drove the cult of the god from the city of Thrace.
Dionysus’s bestial transformation or metamorphosis from man to beast provides still another example of the god’s dichotomy. Dionysus demonstrates his wondrous control over both the animal and natural kingdoms when he creates a shaggy, ravenous bear on board the ship and transforms himself into a mighty lion who mutilates the brash, foolhardy captain. Yet, Dionysus shows his merciful, compassionate nature by sparing the helmsman and the rest of the crew whom he changes into dolphins. Dionysus can be a father figure who forgives if the offender repents, yet a ruthless avenger to those who do not recognize or accept his divinity.
This hymn reveals that Dionysus is capable of appearing both as god and mortal, capable of spreading both joy and sorrow, and capable of unthinkable brutality and genuine kindness. The miracles he performs on board the fated ship dispel any doubt about his divine being. Although this Homeric hymn presents various and conflicting images of Dionysus, it confirms that he, the son of Zeus, is indeed a powerful god.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">The Binding of Andromeda
The depiction of the myth of Perseus and Andromeda upon this vase relates the story to issues of marriage in ancient Greek society. In traditional versions of the myth, Andromeda is shown as a sacrifice to appease a sea monster that is ravaging her father’s lands; however, in the vase’s depiction of the binding of Andromeda, the sea monster is nowhere to be seen, and it is not clear that any part of this scene occurs near a sea. Importantly, the scene from the myth has been taken out of the context of monsters and sacrifice, leaving only the issue of marriage and thus relating the myth to said issue. This is further illustrated by the dress of Andromeda, as she is clearly depicted in wedding garb, especially as she is wearing a veil, and Perseus is seen negotiating with Andromeda’s father, presumably for her hand. This makes it clear that the male figure binding Andromeda does it not for sacrifice, but for marriage. Of note in the negotiations is that Andromeda is not at all present; she is already being tied up, and it is thus suggested by the vase that the woman has no say in the arrangement of marriage. An analogy is made between the binding of Andromeda as a sacrifice and the marriage of Andromeda, as she has no autonomy in either situation, and is used as a medium of exchange in both cases, as Andromeda is given by her father to be sacrificed the same way she is given to be married. All of the figures besides Andromeda are male, and they are depicted as conspiring to determine Andromeda’s marriage for her. Andromeda is bound by masculinity; the idealized image of an unmarried boy ties her to the stakes, for the sake of the male Perseus, and which her father arranges. It is clear from this arrangement that the myth is being considered in the context of marriage, and, as the vase depicts the binding of Andromeda as a male decision, the myth hence suggests that marriage is a male responsibility.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">In Ovid&apos;s Metamorphoses the myth of Narcissus and Echo, Narcissus&apos; desire for his own image contrasts with the beauty of nature demonstrating the undesirability of self-love within Greek culture. When gazing into the river Narcissus&apos; idolization of the self is emphasized as he conceives of his image within the pool as a &quot;marble statue&quot;, his features &quot;worthy of Bacchus or Apollo&quot;, equivalent to the gods themselves. The emphasized nature of his &quot;ivory neck&quot;, &quot;snowy pallor&quot; and eyes as &quot;twin constellation&quot; reference the dangerous idealization of one&apos;s self in contrast to more perfect forms within the natural world. Narcissus&apos; personal conception is compared with the superior and innate beauty of the surrounding river. Untouched as neither &quot;bird nor beast nor falling branch disturbed its shining peace&quot; the immaculate river stands in contrast to Narcissus&apos; fascination with his own beauty. Narcissus is unaware of the pristine surrounding features created by the gods which are inherently admirable. The inability of self-love to produce fruitful results is emphasized by the futility of Narcissius&apos; attempts to connect with his own reflection, within the &quot;limpid and silvery&quot; pool. Narcissus cannot become whole with his own image distraught as his love &quot;kindles with the love he burns&quot;. The act of &quot;striving in vain to catch a fleeting image&quot; within himself mirrors the internally futile experience that his &quot;desiring is desired&quot;. The natural imbalance of this state forever prevents unification or the completion of his yearnings. The destructive nature of self-love is contrasted by a combination of the fading natural and physical forms. The sickly pallor of Narcissus&apos; skin in contrast to the blood which flows from his chest as a result of his physical torment is akin to &quot;apples, white in part and partly red&quot; and grapes &quot;upon the ripening vine a blushing bloom&quot;. His fading form like &quot;wax melts before a gentle fire&quot; and &quot;morning frosts beneath the rising sun&quot; indicates Narcissus&apos; self-destruction to the natural cycle present in the world. The natural beauty of Narcissus emaciation and self-inflicted violence emphasizes the expected, and fitting result of his excessive adoration. As fire burns wax and the sun dries morning frosts so too will self-love inevitably create self-destruction. Narcissus&apos; adulation resulting in his death is intended to match the manner in which the natural world creates equal and opposite reactions. The self-destruction that results from the self-love Tiresias foretells prevents Narcissus from reaching the &quot;ripe old age&quot; the seer told Liriope her son might have had.

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Aristophanes in the comedy Birds parodies the Greek conception of the human inability to comprehend their fate, and the word of the gods present within Sophocles&apos; Antigone. Able to travel between the divine and earthly realm the conception of birds as messengers of the gods is present throughout Sophocles&apos; tragedy. Upon the outset of the play, &quot;birds of prey swoop and feast&quot; upon the corpse of Polynices indicating the god&apos;s displeasure with Creon&apos;s decision to leave Oedipus&apos; son unburied. Teiresias warns Creon of the &quot;strange&quot; and &quot;unnatural&quot; sight of the creatures which had gorged upon Polynices&apos; body, that serve as a indication of the horrid future which is to come. The birds &quot;glutted with the blood of men&quot; and &quot;screaming in rage&quot; began &quot;tearing at each other&quot; with &quot;murderous claws&quot;. The perverse behavior of the birds serves as sign that the actions taken within the kingdom are equally ill-fated. Creon defies the will of the gods further acknowledging that &quot;though Zeus&apos; own eagles eat the corpse&quot; and &quot;bear the carrion to their masters throne&quot; man&apos;s law holds authority over the divination passed down from by the birds by god&apos;s law. The king is blind to the disastrous fate that will befall him while the birds which forewarn his destiny are depicted as more capable of comprehending the judgment of Mt . Olympus than pitiable and ignorant men. Aristophanes&apos; mocks the conception that birds are more gifted in comprehending man&apos;s fate than man himself as divinely ordained creatures. Humans in contrast to the winged &quot;immortal beings&quot; are &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;chained to the earth&quot;, powerless to seek divination directly from the heavens. The leader of the chorus speaking down to the human race boasts that they, the birds are endlessly &quot;occupied by eternal thoughts&quot; yet claiming the willingness to &quot;teach&quot; the human race &quot;about all celestial matters&quot;. Referencing their genealogy, the chorus claims the species holds a connection to the beginnings of existence itself. Originating before the human race with the creation of all things, &quot;Eros with his glittering golden wings... mated in deep Tartarus with chaos&quot;. Birds as &quot;the first to see the light&quot; came into being before the gods themselves, holding an elite status within the origins of all things. The boastful and divine nature of birds asserted by the chorus serves to mock the aggrandized and widely accepted conception of man&apos;s inability to comprehend his fate within Greek society.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">In the cup featuring Dionysus, satyrs, and maenads, painted by Makron, the wild imagery indicates the uncivilized nature of the followers of Dionysus, and thus an uncivilized aspect of Dionysus himself. Despite this wild imagery, Dionysus also appears civilized, showing the ambiguous nature of Dionysus as the god of the in-between.
Surrounding the outside of the cup are maenads, the female followers of Dionysus, dancing wildly and playing music as they are overtaken by his essence in religious worship. Most of the women dance about with bare feet and loose hair, both of which are considered uncivilized and barbaric, especially for Greek women. Further, Makron has depicted the women waving their arms and legs about freely as they dance, indicating the wild nature of the scene as their limbs are not rigidly controlled. Many of the women also hold grape vines in their hands, the purest essence of wine. Typically, wine would be mixed with water in order to lessen the amount of alcohol consumed. Drinking unmixed wine is barbaric and, as the women hold vines, indicating entirely unmixed wine, it is apparent that they are in a drunken state due to their uncivilized and wild nature. In the center of one side of the cup, one maenad holds a deer in her hand. Maenads were known to rip apart small animals, which is an entirely barbaric act, when they were overtaken by the essence of Dionysus. Although the woman has not yet ripped the animal apart, because it is small in comparison to her figure, it can be assumed that she has power over it and may eventually rip it apart.
In comparison to the maenads, Dionysus appears civilized. He stands with his hair controlled, in a stiff posture with his limbs at his sides, and in a long and ornately decorated robe. Despite this controlled imagery, new grape vines grow around Dionysus and it is because of his wine that the women act barbaric, indicating an uncivilized aspect of Dionysus. Further, inside the cup, a satyr is depicted playing a flute to Dionysus. Satyrs, as half-man, half-goats, are in their very essence uncivilized and Dionysus’ association with them adds another uncivilized element to the depiction of Dionysus. In the painting with the satyr, Dionysus is indicated to be barefoot, an act associated with barbarism, and as he holds onto a staff with grape vines, his robe moves and is no longer straight and controlled, indicating a less civilized nature. These contrasting depictions of Dionysus as both civilized and uncivilized show his nature as the god of in-between; he is both civilized and uncivilized and by making the maenads worship him in an uncivilized manner, he makes them civilized through their observation of religion.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">To the Greeks, Artemis and Apollo represented the korai and kouroi, or unmarried youth, of the ancient world. Apollo was the archetype of teenage, unmarried males, while Artemis showed the supposed need for young women to be tamed by marriage. In the myth of their birth, their mother Leto, who is represented as gentle and motherly, was rejected by many lands for fear of Hera’s wrath. She was finally able to settle on Delos to bear Zeus his twins. On the krater she is seen dutifully standing beside her children, who, in turn, are more than willing to defend their mother’s name. This aspect of Artemis and Apollo’s nature is evident in their murder of Niobe’s children. In the twins’ rather extreme reaction to Niobe’s boasting, the Greek ideals of defending family honor and not upsetting the gods by exhibiting hubris are clearly shown. However, in the same myth, the twin gods embody savage and sudden death, exhibiting their impulsive and somewhat immature temperament. Their boyish attributes are also represented in Artemis’ short skirt and Apollo’s lack of facial hair. Artemis’ short skirt, clothing never worn by respected, married women, reflects her ferocity in the hunt. Her adamant preservation of her virginity also reinforces Artemis’ independent, unmarried status, because she does not indulge the whims of any men. As seen in the myths of Action and Orion, men who encroach on her purity are not dealt with forgivingly. Apollo, on the other hand, can still represent the ideal male youth while pursuing and fathering children with other women. These actions, however, only further expose his immaturity because he never is able to fully ensnare the women he lusts after. The only woman who he does have a child with ends up leaving him for a mortal man, emphasizing Apollo’s role as a youthful god, unable to fully set up his own household and family. He is also the god of music, a pastime reserved for young entertainers, making it an unlikely recreational activity for a respected head of a household. Apollo’s ties to music may also be the reason for Hermes’ presence on the krater. Hermes was the original designer of the liar—Apollo’s primary instrument—so his placement, casually looking on as Apollo plays, is fitting. He, however, is not often explicitly associated with Apollo and Artemis, except through music, so his inscription may be there to distinguish him from other idyllic male youths who could also be depicted in relation to the twins. Four of these adolescents are seen on the opposite side of the krater, some of which are holding strigils, alluding to their athletic abilities. Coupling them with Artemis and Apollo also upholds the twins’ idyllic representation of unwed youth, as athletic accomplishments were essential in a respectable juvenescence. Greek society believed that a beautiful exterior mirrored a beautiful soul, so the twins’ physical beauty along with athletic prowess further supported their kore and kouros identities.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">An interpretation of the creation of mankind and the place of humans in society is told in “Birds” by Aristophanes, a satire about the greatness of birds from their perspective. Birds hold an interesting place in the Greek conception of the world around them because they are not godly creatures, yet they are not “chained to the earth” as humans are. “Birds” is a satire and mocking of the general praise of the Olympians by the Greeks.
Aristophanes opens the chorus of “Birds” with “Weak mortals, chained to the earth, creatures of clay as fragile as the foliage of the woods.” The usage of words such as “weak” sets the tone for how humans are to be seen in this piece: as lowly creations. This is comedic because birds are generally seen as more fragile creatures, and can be shot down by humans with bows. It is also interesting that Aristophanes describes humans as “chained to the earth,” referencing that unlike the Olympians, they cannot go to Mt. Olympus or the Underworld. This is an instance of the birds mocking humanity, since birds are able to fly in the sky, closer to Olympus, even though humans see birds as lesser creatures.
In “Birds”, humans are told to “hearken to us, who are immortal beings, ethereal, ever young and occupied with eternal thoughts.” Aristophanes shows here that the gods do not think about humans as much as humans think about the gods since the gods are always “occupied with eternal thoughts.” This is ironic because birds are not immortal either. Additionally, Aristophanes mentions that “even Prodicus will envy you your knowledge.” Prodicus was a 5th Century BC Sophist, who is described by the OCD as valuing Socrates’ work, although usually with a hint of irony. Therefore it is appropriate that Aristophanes would use him as a comparison, because he is not as well-known of a Greek intellect, so the birds saying that Prodicus would envy their knowledge does not say much about the birds’ intellect. Additionally, some today think Prodicus was an atheist (OCD “Prodicus”), which would fit into Aristophanes’ mocking of the Greeks’ extreme religious preoccupation.
Finally, Aristophanes comedically tells the origin of birds in the chorus of Birds. The birds claim that they are descended from Eros and Chaos, both winged creatures, and born before the Titans. “We are the offspring of Eros; there are a thousand proofs to show it,” the birds say, “We have wings and lend assistance to lovers.” This is another way Aristophanes mocks the Greeks’ preoccupation with the Olympians, as he mocks their attempts to prove that they are descendants of an Olympian. The logic the birds use to connect themselves to Eros is incredibly flawed and has little concrete evidence, similar to many Greeks who traced their lineage back to a god. In his satirical piece “Birds”, Aristophanes comments on the Greeks’ relationship with the Olympians.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">The story of Iphigenia emphasizes how mortal women were extremely passive in Greek mythology. There are two aspects of the myth that show this – the first is the plot itself. Iphigenia has no power over what’s happening; she is told she’s being married to Achilles which she seemingly has no say in, and then she is almost sacrificed by her father but doesn’t seem to try and escape or do anything about it. Finally, she is saved by Artemis rather than through her own efforts and is settled as a priestess in fear of Artemis, rather than deciding how and where she wants to live. Although the story is of Iphigenia, and all the events deal directly with her, she has no active role in any of them. The second aspect of the myth that further reinforces the idea of the passive Greek woman is the language that is used. Generally, despite talking in the first person, Iphigenia uses verbs that describe things being done *to* her rather than *by* her. For example, instead of saying ‘I was a sacrifice to Artemis,’ she says “my father sacrificed me to Artemis.” Another example of this is when she says, “I, the unhappy one, was about to die by the sword.” In this example, she could have said ‘they were about to execute me with a sword’ or something similar, but the wording was crafted such that the sword, an inanimate object, seemingly had more power over her life than she did. Although Iphigenia held a passive role in the story, there’s a sharp contrast between her and the other woman in the myth: Artemis. She saves Iphigenia’s life by swapping her for a deer, a move that is not provoked by a male figure and is one that actually disrupts the male-dominated action. Furthermore, she is the one that settles Iphigenia in the land of the Taurians, thus determining the rest of Iphigenia’s life. The language of the myth supports this active nature. A good example of this is in the following lines: “Artemis *gave* the Achaeans a deer in exchange for me and *stole* me from them; *conducting* me through the bright air, [30] *she settled* me here in the land of the Taurians.” There are no passive verbs here, only strong active verbs that indicate that Artemis is in control. While this may seem like a contradiction to the idea that women are passive figures in mythology, there is an important difference between Artemis and Iphigenia: Artemis is a goddess and Iphigenia is not. Therefore, it makes sense that she does things that a mere mortal like Iphigenia cannot do. In fact, it is made clear that Iphigenia is in no way equal to Artemis when she says, “I fear the goddess.” Thus, the story of Iphigenia, which ironically had no participation by Iphigenia herself, represents how mortal women were generally passive participants in Greek mythology.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Homeric Hymn to Dionysus
The Homeric Hymn to Dionysus associates the god with the wild and untamable side of nature by showing him as a creator of wilderness. Dionysus first is shown to be associated with nature, especially wild nature, as the myth establishes ivy and vine as a prominent symbol of Dionysus, both of which are un-tame plants, as they grow without order and without consistency; they are difficult to control. The quality of this nature that Dionysus represents is further developed during the springing of ivy and vine upon the ship, as the ivy-plant is noted to be especially fertile, as it is said to blossom with flowers and berries, while rich wine pours over the ship. All of this suggests that Dionysus is a god of wild abundance, as he creates the fruit-bearing ivy plant and the wine that brings out the wildness in men; he is a provider, but not a traditional provider. Immediately thereafter, Dionysus is also established as a deity of wild beasts, as he creates a bear and a lion to serve him and attack the crewmen. It is important to note here that, unlike other deities associated with beasts, Dionysus is not shown to be a hunter, suggesting that he is a deity of these creatures rather than an order-establishing deity against these creatures. He is shown by the myth to be not of order but of wilderness. He is therefore associated with the fruits of the undomesticated side of nature as well as its dangers, as he provides both rich stocks of food and drink and dangerous beasts to the sailors. There is, as well, a moral to this story. First of all, the myth provides the lesson that one had ought not take strangers hostage, as it is not Themis to do so, and thus the gods will punish you. Secondly, and more importantly, there is the subtler, Dionysian message that one cannot bind the wild, as every attempt to tie up Dionysus fails, and he takes the form of unconquerable beasts, a lion and a bear. Dionysus is thus associated by the myth with the unconquerable, wild side of nature; the myth says that he is, by nature, wild, violent, untamable, but also fruitful, as he is shown to be bountiful and dangerous.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Homer shows the oracular nature of the sea divinities through the literary device of foreshadowing and explicit use of a sea divinity as an oracle by a Greek hero. In book four of the Odyssey, Homer uses Proteus, the old man of the sea, to describe the oracular nature of sea divinities. Menelaus tells Telemachus how Eidethea, daughter of Proteus, came to Menelaus and said that Proteus “will tell thee thy way and the measure of thy path, and of thy return, how thou mayest go over the teeming deep.” (Hom. Od. 4 390) Proteus is portrayed as an oracle who can tell Menelaus the answers to his questions and act as a medium through which the feelings and wishes of the gods can be known. When Menelaus captures Proteus, he asks “Did all the Achaeans return unscathed in their ships, all those whom Nestor and I left, as we set out from Troy?” (Hom. Od. 4 485) Proteus tells Menelaus of the tragedy of Ajax and Agamemnon. He mentions how Ajax angered Poseidon through “a boastful word” (Hom. Od. 4 505) and how Agamemnon was murdered upon his return trip by Aegyptius. Both of these stories strengthen the oracular nature of Proteus by foreshadowing events within the tale of the Odyssey itself. The tale of Agamemnon being ambushed upon his return foreshadows the plan to ambush Telemachus that develops later in the same book of the Odyssey. Proteus’s story of Ajax being destroyed by Poseidon also foreshadows the actions of Odysseus, who after escaping from Polyphemus turns and boasts his name to the Cyclops and evokes the wrath of Poseidon. Proteus not only acts as an oracle to Menelaus but to the reader or listener of the Odyssey as well, foreshadowing moments to come in the Odyssey itself.</chars>

The Styx is a well known and dreaded river in the realm of the Underworld that separates the living and the dead. Accompanied by four other rivers, impure souls travel down in a spiral to eventually meet Hades, with transportation provided by the eerie ferryman, Charon. The consistent flowing of the river reflects the immortality of the human soul, and proves that death will not cleanse a soul of it&apos;s evil deeds.
Plato&apos;s *Phaedo* serves as a warning to people that souls do not expire, and one cannot escape the punishment that they deserve simply by dying. Karma emerges in the Underworld, if a person commits a moral or physical crime while living on Earth, their soul is doomed to suffer. &quot;Now when the dead have come to the place where each is led by his genius, first they are judged and sentenced, as they have lived well and piously, or not.&quot; (Plato, [113d]). It is at this point when a sentence is decided; souls are either destined to endure life in Tartarus for eternity, thrown in Tartarus for a period of time, or released from the Underworld to live in paradise as a reward for living purely.
In the Underworld, circles represent endlessness and fate. The Styx, which spirals around itself, leads to eternal punishment. It is easy to compare Plato&apos;s *Phaedo* to Dante&apos;s *Inferno*, and the nine circles of hell. In both these texts, crimes that are committed during mortal life will be punished harshly in the afterlife, and there is a strong message of living purely to avoid eternal hell. &quot;Consider your origin; you were not formed to live like brutes, but to follow virtue and knowledge&quot;. [(Dante&apos;s Divine Comedy).][1] Humans were never meant to spend eternity in the depths of hell or Tartarus, but if someone were foolish enough to commit murder or act against the gods, then they were destined to it.
In both the river and the layers of hell, the deeper the circles get, the deeper the level of punishment becomes. It was commonly believed that fate was determined by the gods, but humans did have a role in determining their eternal outcome. For instance, living a holy life, avoiding conflict and constantly pleasing the gods would result in paradise after death, and Plato&apos;s *Phaedo* emphasized that. Immortality could be either a gift or a curse, depending on mortal decisions.

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">In Homer’s seventh hymn to Dionysus, Homer describes the ways in which the god of wine is also the god of duality and opposites. Even in his first appearance in the story, the poet illustrates just how contradictory the divine is in his nature. In the opening lines of the hymn, Dionysus appears as a boy who, although on the cusp of adulthood, is still specifically noted to be a boy (“…in the first flush of manhood…” (Homer, Homeric Hymn to Dionysus [7.1])), yet is noted to have “strong shoulders” (Hom. Dionysus [7.5]), which is typical of the ideal Greek man. Being neither a man nor a boy, Dionysus becomes a contradiction in his appearance. However, Homer’s greatest call to the duality of Dionysus’s nature is his actions toward the pirate crew that attempts to capture him; a true study in contrast as a being of both cruelty and kindness. To most of the crew, Dionysus was thought to be someone of high socioeconomic standing, who would likely either lead to the crew’s capture or loss of wealth; thus they seek (and subsequently fail) to bind Dionysus to prevent his escape. In return for their ignorance of Dionysus’s divine presence, Dionysus turns himself into a lion and scares the crew into diving overboard, turning them into dolphins. Also, in this way, Homer illustrates Dionysus as both civilized (in his appearance as an ambiguously-aged, though clearly wealthy, human) and barbaric (in his transformation to a lion) within moments, illustrating that his tendencies to kindness and cruelty are to those who he believes deserves either. Also, given the common device of human metamorphoses in Greek mythology as a sign of permanent change in physical and mental state, this could be interpreted as Dionysus killing the men in their human form. However, one of the men comprehends Dionysus’s strength and inability to be bound as a sign of his divine nature (“’…not even the well-built ship can carry him. Surely this is either Zeus or Apollo…or Poseidon, for he looks not like mortal men but like the gods who dwell on Olympus…’” (Hom. Dionysus [7.15-20])) and, while not realizing who exactly Dionysus is, does try to persuade his fellow men to let the god go free. Instead of being tortured, this man “…found favour with [Dionysus’s] heart” (Hom. Dionysus [7.55]); this man is effectively blessed by Dionysus for recognizing the latter’s divine power and, by extension, being the model Greek citizen who stands in awe of the gods, rather than refusing their wishes and going against fate. In this way, Dionysus is established as kind and cruel, young and old, and, most importantly, having the potential for good and evil in equal measure-he is not the god of any one thing so much as he is the god of differences and what exists between them.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">During Plato&apos;s time (around 400 BCE), there were a few different existing beliefs regarding the afterlife. The detailed description of the underworld that Plato presents in Phaedo closely mirrors many aspects of Christianity, indicating that the founders of Christianity had knowledge of this ancient Greek tradition. As souls arrive to the Underworld, they are judged on how they lived on earth. This judgement process indicates the significance that the members of Greek society placed upon living in accordance with themis. A criminal may be be punished on earth for breaking moral laws, but his crime will also follow him to the afterlife; there is no escaping the justice of themis. Christians, too, view the Ten Commandments in a similar light. If these ten &quot;guidelines&quot; for living in a moral way are not followed on earth, then the sins remain with the soul in the afterlife. Plato&apos;s judges can deem a man &quot;neither well nor ill,&quot; &quot;incurable,&quot; or &quot;curable.&quot; Those who have lived &quot;neither well nor ill&quot; go to the river Acheron to be purified of their sins. Similarly, Christian souls awaiting repentance remain in Purgatory, a level between Heaven and Hell. The &quot;curable,&quot; or Greek sinners who committed crimes but lived the remainder of their lives in repentance, are sent to Tartarus for one year. At the end of this year, they are released through either the Cocytus (&quot;wailing&quot;) or the Pyriphlegethon (&quot;fire&quot;) rivers. These rivers converge at the Acheron lake - the Christian purgatory. From there, souls could beg for forgiveness, calling out to those whom they had offended. This idea of begging for forgiveness mirrors the Christian practice of praying for indulgences.
An indulgence shortened the time a soul spent in purgatory. In contrast to Plato&apos;s belief, however, Christians on earth prayed for indulgences on behalf of dead souls. Plato believed in an approach where the wrongdoer directly begged pardon from the wronged. The sinner would make this journey from Tartarus to the Acheron lake every year until he finally received pardon.
The names of the two rivers, Cocytus and Pyriphlegethon, are also significant. Cocytus is literally the river through which those who &quot;wail&quot; and shout for forgiveness are carried to Acheron, and Pyriphlegethon means &quot;fire.&quot; Curiously, purgatory is often associated with fire, as many Christian texts refer to the cleansing fires of purgatory. Just as real fire burns away impurities, the fires of Pyriphlegethon and Purgatory both symbolize the purification of a soul from sin.
The people who are deemed holy and pure in Plato&apos;s underworld are released and &quot;dwell upon the earth,&quot; presumably as ghosts. Christians, similarly, believe that loved ones are always by their sides watching over them.
One of Plato&apos;s sentences towards the end of this passage reflects the similarity between the two views of the afterlife, as it sounds like if he could be speaking to either a Christian or a Greek: &quot;[...] we ought to do our best to acquire virtue and wisdom in life. For the prize is fair and the hope great.&quot;</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">One of the predominant messages of Sophocles’ play Antigone is the all-powerful influence of the gods. Retribution from higher powers, or fate, is inescapable. King Creon believes that his rule is supreme and uncontested in Thebes. What he fails to understand, though, is that his voice is not what the people of Thebes believe in most ardently. A king needs to acknowledge the supremacy of other powers or else his hubris will bring about his downfall.
Despite Creon’s warning that anybody who tried to bury the body of the traitor Polynieces would face death, Antigone instead follows the mandate of the gods and gives her brother a proper burial. The king, who sentences Antigone to death for her treachery, thereby disrespects the gods in two different ways; not only did refuse to let a dead body be buried through an edict that contradicted the commands of the gods, but he also forces Antigone to be “Hades’ bride.” The blind prophet Teiresias approaches Creon after Antigone has been sentenced to a live burial and tells him that the whole city will be subject to the wrath of the gods. Teiresias understands the strength that the gods possess, and is respectfully fearful of their vengeance. The messenger who eventually lays Polynieces’ body to rest also understands the god’s fury over such an act of hubris. He recounts, “we had prayed to the goddess of the roads and to Pluto to restrain their anger in mercy” before burying him. “The goddess of the roads,” possibly Hecate, and Pluto, the Lord of the Underworld, would presumably be the most infuriated by this breaking of themis. Creon realizes his foolish errors, but he is too late. Upon arriving at Antigone’s tomb to free her, he finds that she has hung herself with her veil. Haimon, Creon’s son and Antigone’s fiancé, is distraught over the death of his love and laments how his father stole her from him. He stabs himself with a sword and as he dies, he turns to Antigone and holds her close. This act physically symbolizes that he chooses her over Creon. He “won his marriage rites, poor boy, not here, but in Hades&apos; palace.”
After Haimon’s suicide, Creon’s wife Eurydice turns back to her house without shedding a tear or mourning. The chorus and the messenger discuss that this “excess of silence” could only mean trouble. Eurydice kills herself, and with that, Creon’s retribution is complete. The king refused to acknowledge another “voice” as having equivalent influence to his, which made him blind to the foolish mistakes he made. He only realizes that submission to the power of the gods is the wisest course of action once he loses all the people he loves. Sophocles wanted his audience to take away the following message: while a king’s authority may inspire obedience out of fear, respect for gods – not an edict of a king – is the loudest command.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">In this passage of Sophocles’ tragedy, Oedipus the King, Teiresias, a blind soothsayer, tells Oedipus that he is “brother and father of the children with whom he consorts, son and husband of the woman who bore him, [and] shedder of his father’s blood” (Sophocles 455). This extract uses light and darkness, as well as sight and blindness, to portray the impossibility of avoiding divine will. The images of light and darkness are an allusion to those who know the truth. Oedipus’ references to light are very ironic to the eyes of the reader who is aware of the truth. Speaking to the only man who knows the truth, he says, “Night, endless night has you in her keeping, so that you can never hurt me, or any man that sees the light of the sun” (375). Oedipus desires to stay in the dark because admitting the truth would be admitting the end of him. He believes what he wants and needs to believe in order to achieve his ambitious goals for glory, wealth and power. Even after Teiresias has been hinting at the truth throughout the conversation, he finally tells Oedipus, “you are the accursed defiler of this land…you are the killer of the man whose slayer you seek”, and still Oedipus is not willing to accept it (350, 360). Oedipus and all the other characters are in the dark about Oedipus’ origins and the murder of Laius. Ironically, the blind sightseer is the only one that knows the truth, his literal blindness contrasts with Oedipus’ metaphorical blindness in refusing to believe the truth. Teiresias spitefully says, “though you have sight, you do not see what a state of misery you are in, or where you dwell, or with whom”(410). Sophocles makes a clear link between sight and knowledge. Ironically, those who can see “are without knowledge”, and the blind seer holds knowledge invisible to them (325). Sight and blindness become an even more evident theme when Oedipus blinds himself at the end of the play like Teiresias had predicted, “your father&apos;s curse will one day drive you from this land in dreadful haste, with darkness upon those eyes of yours which now can see” (415) . Oedipus cannot fight against the curse of the gods, he is powerless to divine will. His identity, his birth make him intrinsically problematic. Teiresias tells him, “you are your own [trouble]”, just by being himself, he is doomed. He carries his burden even in his name, “swollen-feet”, which is a constant reminder of his ill-fated destiny. Oedipus has no control over his future, he has no free will, he is subject to divine will, as the blind soothsayer says, “it is not your fate to fall at my hands, since Apollo, to whom this matter is a concern is sufficient” (375). This passage from Oedipus the King conveys, with great irony, the significance of light and darkness, blindness and sight, and the impossibility of avoiding divine will, in this tragedy.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">This passage of Sophocles’ *Antigone* demonstrates the idea that divine law should come before the laws of men. This is the central theme of the play and this scene clearly shows Antigone saying that one should not follow a human law if goes against themis, and therefore the laws of the gods. Antigone argues for her actions in a quite compelling manner. She went against Creon’s orders “since it was not Zeus that published me that edict” (Perseus). Obviously no man, not even a king, has the authority to make a law if goes against deeply ingrained religious beliefs. In fact it is hubristic to think that one can legislate against divine law. Antigone implies that Creon is guilty of this sort of prideful thinking when she accuses him of trying to “override the unwritten and unfailing statutes given us by the gods” (Perseus). Her insinuation places any wrongdoing that may have happened on Creon’s shoulders instead of her own.
Another one of the ways in which the text shows the superiority of divine over mortal law is Antigone’s conviction in her decision to break Creon’s law. Honest from her first line, Antigone admits to her actions and to the fact that she knew that what she was doing was illegal. This honesty is important because it seals her fate. She reveals to Creon that she had intentionally committed the “crime” of symbolically burying her brother, Polynices, which is punishable by death. The intention behind the act makes it clear that Antigone has already made the decision to follow divine law instead of Creon’s edicts, because she knows that what she did was the right thing to do morally. It also means that she is confident enough in her choice that she doesn’t feel the need to hide behind ignorance in an attempt to avoid punishment. She almost seems to welcome her punishment in line 463 when she says “… if I am to die before my time, I count that a gain” (Perseus). In her opinion the world around her was so filled with evil, which was caused by the breaking of themis, that dying was a better alternative to living surrounded by these transgressions. Antigone’s willingness to die for her belief and to escape an immoral world further cements the idea that the laws of the gods are more important than mortal laws.
These lines demonstrate idea that divine law needs to be followed above all else through Antigone’s faith in the superiority of godly edicts and the conviction that her own actions are correct.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Thucydides’ view of Greek society around the period of the Trojan War shows how the evolution of a Pan Hellenic identity in the 6th and 5th century B.C. caused a subsequent evolution in the views and perceived progress of the Greek’s own history. Thucydides’ view of ancient Greece around the Trojan War is one of no union among the Greek people as a whole. Hesiod, in his Works and Days, describes the same society around the time of the Trojan War as an “Age of Heroes”, being filled with “heroic men” and ending in a state “untouched by sorrow” and “ (bearing) honey-sweet fruit” (Hes. WD 170) The heroes in this golden age epitomize the strength of their community and forge their community’s identity. Thucydides agrees with Hesiod and explicitly mentions this tie between a community’s hero and the identity of the people when he says “those that with Achilles came out of Phthiotis and were the first so called”. Hesiod, who lives in a Greek society ruled by local rulers, viewed his own society as one that regresses from an era when local rulers were great heroes. Hesiod explicitly shows this sentiment when he describes his own age as an “Age of Iron”, one still made by “Far-seeing Zeus” but ultimately with “no defense against evil” (Hes. WD 174.) Thucydides however, writes after a time of great unification amongst the Greek people in which they fought off the Persian Empire. To Thucydides, Homer’s tale of heroes seems not to be a golden time of powerful independent Greek communities but a time of disorganized chaos in which achievements and progress are inhibited by the lack of coordination across Greek society. While the Trojan heroes still epitomize the strength of the communities they come from, Thucydides shows how the Greeks began to look back and reinterpret their cultural history with a “Pan Hellenic” mindset. Within this Pan Hellenic view, the heroes of Homer’s Iliad who defeated a foreign people at Troy mirrored the current Greek states fighting against the Persians. Plutarch writes that the warriors at the battle of Marathon in 490 BC “saw an apparition of Theseus in arms rushing on in front of them against the Barbarians” (Plut. Thes. 35.5) Theseus, a hero of Athens and the man responsible for Athenian unification (synoikismos), is not only defending “his” city but all of Greece when he leads the Greeks against the barbarians. As the Greeks found themselves united against a great barbaric force, the heroes that had once symbolized the strength of a local people now symbolized the strength of a Pan Hellenic unity. This new interpretation of Greek cultural history in the context of Pan Hellenic unity causes Thucydides to look back upon earlier Greek times with some sense of inferiority.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">In Ovid’s famous epic poem, Metamorphoses, he recounts the myth of Apollo and Daphne. In the myth, Cupid shoots two arrows. One makes Apollo fall in love with Daphne and the other makes Apollo appear repulsive to Daphne. Fueled by desire, Apollo pursues Daphne relentlessly. Just as Apollo is about to have Daphne, her father intervenes and turns his own daughter into a laurel tree so that she could escape Apollo’s advances.
It is important to put this poem in the context of the time it was written. Ovid wrote the Metamorphoses during the Age of Augustus. By AD 8, Ovid had completed the Metamorphoses. Interestingly, in this same year, the emperor, Augustus banished Ovid to Tomis. Although the exact reason for Ovid’s banishment is unknown, Ovid wrote that the reason was carmen et error, meaning “a poem and a mistake”(Biography of Ovid). It is likely that some of the content in Ovid’s other most famous work, the Amores, angered Augustus and was the cause of his banishment. In the Amores, Ovid writes about adultery, which was rendered illegal by Augustus’s marriage law reforms of 18 B.C., known as the Julian Laws (Biography of Ovid). Accordingly, in Ovid’s retelling of the myth of Daphne and Apollo, he depicts Daphne as an upstanding follower of the Julian Laws.
Apollo, as a god, represents uncontrolled youth. He embodies that teenage stage in life where one is physically capable of bearing children, but not yet ready to marry and settle down. Therefore Apollo cannot marry Daphne, because marriage would contradict everything that Apollo represents as a god. However, he cannot help but be drawn to Daphne.
Apollo’s desires and intentions for Daphne strictly break the moral codes stated in the Julian Laws established by Augustus. Daphne, however, represents what Augustus believes is the ideal, moral young girl. In the Julian Laws of 18 BC, monogamous marriage is encouraged to increase the population’s birth rate. Sexual affairs before marriage are forbidden (Biography of Ovid). Daphne would rather lose her beauty by being transformed into a laurel tree than lose her virginity; especially to a man that is not her husband. Daphne refuses to break the Julian Laws.
Furthermore, Daphne is turned into a laurel tree, associating her with a lofty Roman symbol. Laurel wreaths, in Roman and Greek culture, were a symbol for eternal honor, love and glory. While Ovid clearly angered Augustus when he wrote about adultery in his other poems, he also wrote poems with characters that exemplify the values that Augustus wished all Romans to display.

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">In Homer’s Odyssey, a minstrel invited to an assembly of Phaecians for Odysseus tells the story of Hephaestus capturing Ares and Aphrodite while she is being disloyal, emphasizing the triumph of relationships as a weakness in the face of physical strength. Both Hephaestus and his wife Aphrodite manage to defeat Ares in some way or another through their actions in the myth, despite his position as the god of war and brute strength. Aphrodite herself is the goddess of love and relationships and manages to cultivate a relationship with Ares, essentially taming his impulsive and violent actions. Eros, the infamous child that they create together is a blend of their two distinct characteristics. The small god remains a child throughout his life and is often shown with angelic wings, strongly tying him to his mother’s generative symbolism. However, Eros is equipped with a quiver of arrows that will cause even the most powerful mortals and gods to succumb to the power of love, as Ares does with Aphrodite. Hephaestus too is not immune to the supremacy of relationships though Homer refers to him as “the famous god of the two strong arms” (345), alluding to his position as the god of blacksmiths and other craftsman who require strength for their work. Despite his strength, Hephaestus is upset by Aphrodite’s promiscuity and failure to remain loyal to their marital relationship, even though all of the Olympians tend to err on the side of promiscuity. Driven by his anger, he manages to capture Ares and Aphrodite in the act, attempting to destroy their sexual relationship by shaming them in front of the other gods, unsuccessfully as the minstrel says. In explaining his motivations for capturing the couple, Hephaestus refers to the “debt and bonds” (350) that Ares owes him. The fact that he is unsuccessful in his attempt is a moot and the fact remains that the anger that consumed him regarding Ares’ encroachment on his relationship with Aphrodite overpowered his own strength and allowed him to overpower the strength of Ares, the very god of brawn itself. In many ways, this parallels the events that occur later in Ithaca when Odysseus returns home to his wife Penelope, who, unlike Aphrodite, has remained loyal to him but is surrounded by young, strong, suitors anxious to take Odysseus’ throne in his absence. In a face to face battle between the young men and Odysseus, Odysseus would most likely be defeated as result of their strength in numbers and Penelope would have been forced to abandon her relationship with Odysseus and choose a new husband and king. However, Odysseus fights for his own relationship with Penelope, triumphs over the suitors through craftiness and is able to reestablish himself as her husband. The suitors’ weakness was that they were not fighting for a strongly established relationship and like Ares and Hephaestus, were overcome by the power of emotional connection that undermined their strength.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">In Sophocles’ Antigone, Antigone faces a major internal conflict— split between abiding by the laws of man, or the laws of god. Since she is mortal, she is held under two separate sets of laws, and therefore punishable by both. Though Creon clearly dictates that she cannot properly bury her brothers, Antigone does so regardless, because it is in her religion and in the gods’ words to do so. This myth speaks volumes to the people as it exemplifies the internal tension and struggle between following the gods’ law when it contradicts man’s laws. Antigone serves as an example of following the gods’ laws as it aligns with her internal religion and innate beliefs, regardless of man’s laws.
From the very first line that Antigone speaks in this excerpt, her unabashed, unapologetic tone is made evident. She openly admits to her mistake and “makes no denial” to her breaking of Creon’s law. (443) Even with full knowledge of the edict and its consequences, Antigone does not feel ashamed. She knows that if she had followed Creon’s law, she would be breaking the gods’ law and her own religion. Therefore, Antigone breaks man’s laws with full knowledge of the consequences, as she values gods’ laws more.
Antigone believes that King Creon’s laws hold no force and no weight— the edict is easily breakable, and she has no problem disobeying it. This is contrasted by how Antigone views the gods’ laws— as “unfailing statutes.” (455) The respect in which she sees in their words proves how much she values them, and therefore cannot break them.
The power of the god’s edicts stem from that length of time that they existed. Antigone describes how the gods’ lives were “not of today or yesterday, but for all time,” (457) and since the gods have been in existence for far longer than humans have, they are much wiser, and therefore their laws hold much more weight than the laws of man, therefore she follows their edicts but breaks Creon’s.
Since Antigone is subject to both man and god’s law, she is punishable by both. There is no vagueness or ambiguity in the punishments of her crime— she buried her brothers even with the full complete knowledge that her punishment would be death. “Die I must, that I knew well.” (460) Antigone explicitly states that she does not fear the mortal punishment. She views her life as being “surrounded by evils”, so that dying is considered as a gain.” (464) Since she is completely aware of the punishment of breaking man’s law, and is completely unafraid of it, she has no problem breaking Creon’s law. This is contrasted with the punishment that would have ensued if she had broken the gods’ laws and not followed her own religion. Since she is not fearful of the punishment from breaking man’s law, and has no problem breaking it, Antigone chooses the gods’ words over man’s.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Both Oedipus and Tiresias are revered intellectuals, however one is a king and the other a beggar; two extremes that mirror each other throughout the play. This mirroring aspect is further emphasized through the idea that Oedipus and Tiresias are foil characters for one another with Oedipus representing the worldly powers and Tiresias serving the divine. /
Oedipus gained the throne through the resolution of the riddle and truly believed that he was the most astute individual in Thebes. Using his wit, he managed to save the citizens of Thebes, including Tiresias whom Oedipus assumed could not solve it because he lacked the skill to do so. “There was need of a seer&apos;s help, and you [Tiresias] were discovered not to have this art, either from birds, or known from some god. But rather I, Oedipus the ignorant, stopped her, having attained the answer through my wit alone, untaught by birds.” (395-399) Thus, the clever Oedipus solved a riddle of the earth, via the Sphinx which is a creature of the earth, and by interpreting prophecies, the wise Tiresias solves the riddle of the gods. 
Oedipus became the revered king of Thebes through a course of events beginning with the murder of his father and ending with a marriage to mother. He gained earthly admiration through his actions, which are the most horrendous of crimes in the divine world. Tiresias has a similar fate. He has the gift of foresight but has to deal with “how terrible it is to have wisdom when it does not benefit those who have it.” (316) He bears the burden of condemning his king (treason) in order to save the city and its citizens, a noble action. When Tiresias decided to do what was right by the gods, Oedipus accused the loyal citizen of willingly trying to wrong his king. Tiresias replied by saying that “No, it is not your [Oedipus’] fate to fall at my hands, since Apollo, to whom this matter is a concern, is sufficient.” (376). Apollo is mentioned as a way for Tiresias to support his actions; he is following the gods. /
Another central theme relating to Oedipus as a worldly power and Tireseas as a godly one is blindness. Oedipus has worldly eyesight but he is blind to the divine implication. Tiresias sees clearly the will of the gods though he cannot physically see. This is shown in the end, once Oedipus realized the truth and saw the curse he has lived in, he took his eyes out; he did not want to see the earthly misery he caused through his blindness of the divine. Thus Tireseas’ words became true “Blind who now has eyes, beggar who now is rich, he will grope his way toward a foreign soil, a stick tapping before him step by step” (517). Oedipus was oblivious to this part of his life while divine judgment served as the beacon by which Tiresias abided.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Although the passage (266-366) in Odyssey Book 8 focuses on the adultery of Ares and Aphrodite, and the timeless issue of brains vs. bronze, its thematic undertone is the power of underestimation. Ares the “destructive… Comely and strong of limb” (Odyssey Book 8 310-315) drunk on his own superiority complex and sense of self, thinks nothing of his adulterous transgressions with Aphrodite because he comforts himself in believing that no threat can come from Hephaestus, the lame one. Although lame, Hephaestus is the intellectually superior God and uses Ares’ breaking of themis and the bonds of marriage to teach him a lesson in the powers of underestimation. “He went his way to his smithy, pondering evil in the deep of his heart, and set on the anvil block the great anvil and forged bonds which might not be broken or loosed, that the lovers might bide fast where they were” (Odyssey Book 8 270-277). The Greek god of craftsmanship did not create this unbreakable net for the sole reason of exhibiting Aphrodite and Ares’ unbecoming behavior, but to match up his strengths of craftsmanship and intelligence against Ares’ of brawn. The rendering of Ares’ brawn useless in Hephaestus’ strong net not only impacted Ares’ superiority complex but reminded him of the power of underestimation and that sometimes those labeled “push-over” do push back. Underestimation also permeates in the parallel of this story which is of Odysseus’ quarrel with Euryalus at the Phoenician court. Just as Hephaestus was overlooked by Ares as one who would pose a threat, Odysseus (relative of Sisyphus) was disregarded as a one capable of manly events. Euryalus, just like Ares, is dexterous in the arts of physicality with their large bodies and brute force, they both let their respective egos cloud not only there judgment but their views on reality. Reality being that strength and beauty is not the driving forces of the universe, because what good is all the physical prowess of the world if lacking the intellectuality to know that being well rounded beats being one-dimensional, and being open-minded trumps narrow-minded. “Another again is in comeliness like the immortals, but no crown of grace is set about his words. So, in thy case, thy comeliness is preeminent, nor could a god himself mend it, but in mind thou art stunted.”(Odyssey Book 8 174-176). The powers of underestimation in both stories act not only as a reality check but also as a teaching tool for those who are gifted but not humble.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Though athletic victors were celebrated as prominent figures in Ancient Greek society, Pindar’s tenth “Pythian Ode” humbles those feats by comparing them to the accomplishments of the gods.To the Greeks, being a victor meant much more than winning athletic competitions; they were exemplars of discipline, strength and courage, and were respected by all members of society. When Pindar first introduces Hippocleas, describing him as “the greatest of the boys,” for winning “the double-course footrace” (9), he highlights the importance of athletic victory in Greek society. Furthermore, Pindar suggests that victors must encompass admirable qualities in addition to skillfulness: the victor “takes the greatest prizes through his courage and strength” (24). Pindar then describes his purpose for writing the song stating, “I will make Hippocleas even more admired for his garlands by boys his age and by his elders” (57), indicating that victors gained respect across all age groups.However, despite society’s reverence for their victors, Pindar does not fail to remind us that mortal accomplishments pale in comparison to the feats of the gods and heroes. Pindar tells of the hero Perseus’s journey to the land of the Hyperboreans and of his quest to kill the Gorgon Medusa, two feats that could never be accomplished by a mere mortal. Pindar specifically warns, “neither by ship nor on foot could you find the marvelous road to the meeting-place of the Hyperboreans—” (30). However, because Perseus is half-immortal, he transcends the boundaries of the physical world. Furthermore, Perseus succeeded in his quest to kill the Gorgon Medusa, a feat to which Pindar comments: “To me nothing that the gods accomplish ever appears unbelievable, however miraculous” (50). Clearly, a mortal like Hippocleas could not achieve the “miraculous” feats that Perseus accomplishes.Pindar minimalizes Hippocleas’s success in athletic competitions by comparing them to Perseus’s journeys across the mythological world. He explicitly describes the limitations of men: a victor “can never set foot in the bronze heavens; but whatever splendor we mortals can attain, he reaches the limit of that voyage” (26). Pindar effectively elevates heroes to the highest level of glory, while still managing to recognize the limitations of their mortality. By hoping that Hippocleas and his lineage “encounter no envious reversals at the hands of the gods” (21), Pindar recognizes the power of the gods to uphold the hierarchy. Pindar both celebrates Hippocleas’s victory in the footrace and pays homage to the deities who transcend the feats of man.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">While these vases share the function of being used for wine, each of the vases emphasizes a different aspect of Dionysus’ character. Through theater, liberation of female worshipers, and interaction with human-animal hybrids, Dionysus represents the controlled rebellion necessary to maintain a civil society.
On the inside of the zone cup are men at a symposium surrounding an image of a gorgoneion, Medusa&apos;s severed head (Schmidt). This ties to Dionysus’ role as the god of masks and theater because the gorgoneion was sometimes worn as a mask. Through theater and the wearing of masks, people are able to pretend to be some one they are not. In some ways, acting is an accepted manner to lie to others by being released from the constraints of identity. This is also tied to the consumption of alcohol at the symposium because it is a social event where the pressure to behave in a certain way is relieved by intoxication.
Images of the maenads on the kylix with Dionysus demonstrate the power of Dionysus as a liberator through women entheos. By dancing wildly outside at night they are acting in discordance with civil society. The act of sparagmos indicated by the small animal is another example of the maenads freeing themselves from societal constraints. This vase illustrates the worship of Dionysus as a designated period for overturning the regulations of traditional society.
In the kylix that includes satyrs and maenads worshiping Dionysus together, some of the satyrs are in a state of arousal as everyone dances. As satyrs are half human and half animal, the represent a certain aspect of untamed humanity that gives in to desire, liberated from civilized behavior. Dionysus is often associated with human-animal hybrids due to the liberating nature of his being. The kylix with the satyrs also shows Dionysus standing before an altar. This was on the tondo, or the circular bottom of the kylix (Oakley). Due to the placement of this image, it could be intended to show the introspective and divine side of Dionysus, as the god in charge of liberating the soul.
Dionysus crosses the line between truth and deception, civil and uncivil, tamed and untamed. He invites intoxication and unbounded revelry as a release from the societal pressures that are faced every day. Dionysus incites acts of rebellion, in moderation, as necessary reprieves from the fetters of a civil existence. Dionysus represents the freedom that gives law its true importance.

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">This section from Homer’s Odyssey describes the moments following Ares’ and Aphrodite’s capture by Hephaestus, as they are caught engaging in an affair. Following their release, Ares and Aphrodite “sprang up straightway. And Ares departed to Thrace,” (8.362) while “laughter-loving Aphrodite, went to Cyprus, to Paphos, where is her demesne and fragrant altar” (8.363-4). Both run away rather than staying in Olympus to face the consequences of their actions. Moreover, the locations to which they flee reveal much about the deities themselves. Thrace is a land of barbarians, which reflects on Ares’ very nature as a god; he himself is brute, barbaric, and brash. This latter trait is clearly illustrated by the recent affair; had Ares used good judgment and foresight, he would not have found himself in such a compromising situation. Aphrodite, in turn, goes to her own altar after the affair, where her worshippers welcome her. Each deity escapes to a place where they know they will be accepted. Yet, though both follow this same course of action, it is ultimately Ares who faces the brunt of the criticism.
While Ares is received as a laughingstock, Aphrodite does not face nearly as humiliating a response; in fact, the gods pay barely any attention to her. All that is said by the text is that she goes somewhere and cleaned up. She is dressed in lovely clothes and &quot;anointed&quot; (8.365), a word with a strongly religious connotation (indicating that it is almost as if she is being commended for what she just did). She is made to be &quot;a wonder to behold” (8.367), reinforcing the idea that she is well-received after the affair. Indeed, she seemingly faces no repercussions. It is interesting that these lines say nothing more about the consequences of this affair on Aphrodite, especially considering how vastly different a response she receives than Ares.
The gods receive Ares and Aphrodite differently after the scandal because they are received differently as deities in general; as Ares is a weak god, his reception would, naturally, not be favorable. Even before Ares runs away, Hephaestus and Poseidon predict he will “avoid the debt and flee away” (8.356)—which, of course, he does. Interestingly, though, they do not expect the same of Aphrodite.
Ares’ depiction as a weak god is inherently ironic; he is the god of war, of brute combat. By extension, the expectation should be that he would be a strong deity. However, his weakness makes sense; after all, Ares is the god of passionate action, and such unchecked passion is itself a danger and a weakness. Considering that Ares evokes this violent passion, it is fitting that he mate with Aphrodite, the goddess of romantic passion. The gods’ different reactions to the pair similarly highlights Ares as a weak god: he must be one of the weakest deities if he, a male, is deemed weaker and more blame-worthy than a female counterpart.

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">In this excerpt of Ovid’s Metamorphoses, a powerful rendition of a significant mythological event is illustrated—a flood facilitated by Zeus, or Jupiter as he is known in Roman text, to purge the world of man’s impurity. One prominent theme that permeates this myth is the inferiority of mortals with respect to the gods. The theme of mortal inferiority can be traced throughout numerous myths in Greek culture.
In the rendition of this myth by Ovid, the flood generated by Jupiter voiding the Earth of man (except for two) was brought about due to his disgust with mortal human wrongdoing and lack of morality among the population. This was not an act of destruction, but a purge and cleansing of evil and wrongdoing from Earth. It is significant to note that Jupiter brought about his wrath in order to improve the world, supporting his authority and themis. The water that overtook the Earth is symbolic of life, not death. In order for life to exist, there must be water. Thus, Jupiter chose to flood the Earth in an effort to cleanse it.
The expression of divine power in response to mortal wrongdoing and hubris is exemplary in countless myths. For example, the terrible fates of Niobe and Actaeon were a result of insulting and violating, respectively, the goddess Artemis. Artemis, the oftentimes fierce virgin goddess of the hunt, was relentless in her punishment of these poor mortals. Many of the gods exhibit similar episodes in which they punish mortals severely for their wrongdoings. The harsh consequences of defying the gods reassert the superiority of the divine, and kept Greeks moral, pious, and civil as a whole.
Two important mortals were spared from the flood by Jupiter, Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha, due to their wisdom and piety. Deucalion, son of Prometheus, was bright and loyal to the gods, and Pyrrha was in good relations with the gods due to her undying worship. These two were model mortals in the Greek world, and could be seen as models for all Greeks to live by, which justifies them being chosen to repopulate the Earth. Ovid closes this passage depicting this: “…every stone Deucalion threw should take the form of man, and those by Pyrrha cast should woman’s form assume: so we are hardy to endure and prove by toil and deeds from what we sprung.” (Ovid, Metamorphoses, Book 1, lines 411-415.) Thus, after the flood had subsided, the world was populated once again with people of better moral value, based upon the pious and pure lives of Deucalion and Pyrrha.
Ultimately, this is yet another myth exemplary of the theme that mortals were at the disposal of the gods, and often suffered substantially from any actions that would suggest otherwise. This was a crucial concept in Greek society to keep social order among the population.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Euripides’ *The Bacchae* and Aristophanes’ *Frogs* present two contradicting characterizations of the god Dionysus. On the surface, these two plays have much in common: both playwrights wrote around the same time, and for the same Athenian audience, and the plays themselves both premiered at the City Dionysia at the end of the fourth century B.C., probably within a few years of one another (OCD, Euripides, Aristophanes). *The Bacchae* and *Frogs* do not differ in their historical context or their audience, but in their genres as tragedy and comedy.
*The Bacchae* is a tragedy. In it, Euripides portrays Dionysus as a powerful, vengeful god who has come to Thebes, his ancestral home, seeking vengeance on those who challenge his legitimacy as an Olympian. The play opens with a sort of prologue in which Dionysus himself addresses the audience, providing this background information on his presence in Thebes and illustrating his plan to initiate the women of the city into his cult of Maenads. Dionysus carries out his plan with ease. He even engages the sententious King Pentheus and, capitalizing on the king’s secret desire to view the Maenads, leads him to a gory death at the hands of his own converted mother, Agave. Euripides’ Dionysus never stops scheming. He is proud, manipulative, highly intelligent, and totally unforgiving; he even punishes his own grandfather, Cadmus, one of the only Thebans who wouldn’t openly challenge him. This characterization of Dionysus conforms perfectly to the play’s tragic plot.
The comic Dionysus of Aristophanes’ *Frogs* could not be more different. Unlike the intelligent, capable god of *The Bacchae*, Aristophanes’ Dionysus jokes and complains his way through this humorous journey to the underworld in order to retrieve his favorite poet, Euripides. In stark contrast to Euripides’ dramatic opening prologue, *Frogs* begins with the god participating in a joke about bodily functions, and then proceeds to follow Dionysus and his long-suffering servant Xanthius on a journey that reveals this version of Dionysus to be not only feeble and lazy, but downright cowardly as well. He complains about everything from blisters and an aching backside to the noises made by frogs, actually a poetic song about Dionysus himself and his Olympian brethren. Dressed as Heracles, Dionysus attempts to take every advantage of this heroic disguise for himself, but forces Xanthius to assume the identity whenever an enemy of Heracles threatens a more dangerous outcome. Comically, this never seems to work out in Dionysus’s favor, proving that he is far less skilled in manipulation than his tragic counterpart. In both plays, Dionysus announces a plan in his first scene onstage, but Aristophanes’ Dionysus fails to follow through, instead deciding to save Aeschylus from the underworld and leave Euripides behind, proving him indecisive as well.
While the nature of *The Bacchae* requires Euripides to portray Dionysus as intelligent, decisive and cruel in order for the play to reach its tragic outcome, the comic Aristophanes must characterize him as the opposite: cowardly, dithering and dumb.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Ares, God of War, was known for being the violent and untamed aspects of war. Armies often made sacrifices to him before battle, as he represented the physical strength neccesary to attain victory in combat. So in theory, Ares should be a fighter of unmatched abilities, able to destroy his enemies with ease. However, while Ares certainly is a powerful warrior, the Iliad shows Ares to be much less powerful than his title of God of War suggests.
In Book V of the Iliad, Ares is initially depicted as being an unstoppable killing force. When he finally enters the battle field, Hektor and Ares, fighting side by side push the Greeks back significantly, killing a number of notable Achaeans including “Godlike Teuthras and … Orestes, driver of horses” (5.705). Ares&apos;s might was so notable that no warrior dared to approach him. Even the mighty Diomedes, who fought with power given to him by Athena, saw Ares and was stricken with fear: “At sight of him Diomedes, good at the war-cry shuddered (5.595). Even Athena recognizes the impact Ares was having on the battle field: while pleading with Zeus to let her interfere with Ares on the battlefield, Athena remarks, “Father Zeus, hast thou no indignation with Ares for these violent deeds, that he hath destroyed so great and so goodly a host of the Achaeans recklessly and in no seemly wise to my sorrow”(5.757-760). Ares is definitely a mighty warrior; however, as soon as Athena enters the fray, of battle, Ares finally faces defeat.
When Athena and Diomedes unite forces on the battle-field, Ares is revealed to be much less powerful than one might suppose from a god of his title, God of War. While Diomedes is initially opposed to the idea of fighting Ares, as he recognizes the god has been “lording it over the battle-field”(5.824), he is convinced by Athena to attack Ares. At first glance, these two figures fighting the divine embodiment of brutal war might seem like an impossible quest. After all, typically in Greek Mythology, a mortal and a female deity, even the powerful Athena, would never be able to successfully confront a male Olympian in his natural setting, which in Ares&apos;s case is the field of battle. However, as soon as Diomedes and Athena charged at Ares, Diomedes “drave at Ares with his spear of bronze, and Pallas Athene sped it mightily against his nethermost belly, where he was girded with his taslets”(5.856-7). And when Ares flees to Mount Olympus, his inner weaknesses are completely exposed as he, “grieved at heart”(5.869), begins “wailing”(5.870) to Zeus like a sniveling child.
So while Ares does in fact fight with great strength, the Iliad depicts Ares as being much less powerful than his title indicates.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">The Homeric Hymn to Dionysus confirms his identity as the god of contradictions, as he possesses many different characteristics and epithets yet unites them into one comprehensive character. This incongruity that is unique to Dionysus can be seen immediately in the first few lines of Hymn 7. He is described as a &quot;stripling in the first flush of manhood,&quot; or a young boy who has just crossed over to maturity. The next line, however, mentions his long hair flowing over his &quot;strong shoulders.&quot; Physical strength and fitness was a sign of manhood in Greek society, but Dionysus is both a young boy and a matured adult.
The next paradox occurs shortly after the first; while the sailors are fruitlessly trying to bind Dionysus in ropes, he wears a &quot;smile in his dark eyes.&quot; The god is enjoying the pathetic attempts on the part of the sailors to constrain him, but is also furious at their disrespect and ignorance. There is one man, however, who does recognize the glory of the god before him. The lone sailor speaks up and urges the rest of the men to let Dionysus go, lest the wrath of the god come upon them. He is mocked by the crew and called a &quot;Madman.&quot; This is certainly significant - the followers, or believers, of Dionysus were thought to be insane and mad with the power of the god. One of Dionysus&apos;s many epithets, &quot;manikos,&quot; or &quot;The Mad One (1),&quot; represents this quality. As the remaining crew members declare the man &quot;mad,&quot; they do not realize that his &quot;madness&quot; will save him and their &quot;sanity&quot; will condemn them. Dionysus turns into a lion and creates a bear to show the disbelievers his true potency. Again, Dionysus&apos;s actions are in accordance with another epithet; he was often called &quot;bromios,&quot; or &quot;The Roarer(1).&quot; Though this name was originally derived from the fact that the worship of Dionysus created much noise, it is noteworthy that the author chose to associate the god with two wild animals that roar instead of more passive creatures. Finally, Dionysus has revealed himself to the sailors and the crew jumps ship in fright. Only the &quot;Madman&quot; who saw the true glory of Dionysus is saved, exemplifying a third epithet: Eleutherios, or &quot;The Liberator(3).&quot; Dionysus&apos;s mercy illustrates one of his fundamental characteristics; those who believe in him and who worship him will benefit and be joyous, while those who deny his existence face nothing but a miserable fate. Of course, these two temperaments do not appear to be congruous, but Dionysus, after all, is the god who harmonizes contradictions.

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">The description of Athena’s clothes in the passage of the Illiad is important as a symbol of her role as Zeus’ counterpart, while indicating that Athena will always be inferior to Zeus because of her gender.
This passage describes a transformation of Athena as she puts on armor in preparation for battle: “But Athene, daughter of Zeus that beareth the aegis, let fall upon her father&apos;s floor her soft robe, richly broidered, that herself had wrought and her hands had fashioned” (735-740). The removal of her robe that she made with her own hands signifies Athena’s detachment from her role as a goddess of embroidery and weaving, of women’s work, in times of battle. Instead, she wears the robe of the powerful divine ruler, her father, Zeus. This is something that could only be done by someone worthy of being Zeus’ counterpart, as otherwise it would end in disaster as someone attempted to reach the power of Zeus. Still, the description of her feminine garb reminds the reader that Athena is a woman and thus tied to female tasks.
The placement of the aegis is also significant as a symbol of Athena’s role as Zeus’ complement: “About her shoulders she flung the tasselled aegis, fraught with terror, all about which Rout is set as a crown […]” (740). The aegis is a great defense to have in battle, and therefore a symbol of authority to posses. By donning the aegis, Athena carries strife, valor, and onset on her shoulders. However, Homer also describes Zeus as one that “beareth the aegis” (745). By both being marked as bearers of the aegis, Athena and Zeus are wielding a symbol of power as the mightiest god and goddess, the divine rulers of all. Yet while bearing the aegis symbolizes Athena’s wisdom, power, and strength, it does not escape notice that Athena shares the aegis with Zeus without having its complete ownership.
After a passage that describes Athena shedding her femininity and wearing a horned helmet that holds warriors “of an hundred cities”, and carrying a great spear, it is surprisingly not followed by an epithet that refers to her unique feminine power (745). Instead, Homer refers to her as the “daughter of Zeus” and “daughter of the mighty sire” (735,750). While this familial bond strengthens her connection to Zeus, it also weakens her power by assigning a gendered role. It reminds the reader that despite being a great warrior and powerful counterpart to Zeus, Athena is still a woman. Athena will always be wearing Zeus’ clothes, sharing the aegis with Zeus but never being in full possession of its power, and matching Zeus’ strength but never exceeding it. Athena may be Zeus’ counterpart, but she can never be his equal.

Though not consistent with the accepted patriarchal society of Homer’s time, Zeus reveals clear favoritism for his daughter Athena to his son Ares through his separate interactions with each of his children. When Hera and Athena first approach Zeus for permission to fight Ares in the Trojan War, Zeus’s encouragement of Athena showcases his confidence in his daughter. When Homer recounts Zeus’s reply to Hera, (Hom. Il. 5.765), not only does Zeus believe that Athena has the innate right and ability to defeat Ares, but he also dismisses Hera’s plead for her own involvement. Even without directly communicating with Athena herself, Zeus shows that he believes that Athena, not Hera, should fight against Ares; he has effectively elevated his favorite daughter over both his wife and his eldest son.
Furthermore, when Ares returns to Olympus, he overtly accuses Zeus of favoring Athena to all other gods (Hom. Il. 5.876-881), showing that he recognizes the preferential treatment that Athena receives. Ares acknowledges that he is second to Athena, a fact emphatically confirmed by Zeus himself: “Most hateful to me art thou of all gods that hold Olympus, for ever is strife dear to thee and wars and fightings” (Hom. Il. 5.890). By referring to Ares’ violent and futile tendencies, Zeus highlights his preference of strategic combat to force and reckless killing. Athena, born by Zeus alone, “fully armed” and “from the top of his head” (Apollod. 1.3), represents wisdom and strategy in warfare, two attributes of Zeus himself. Zeus, a representation of universal and civilized order, obviously prefers strategic combat to Ares’s futile and reckless killing, and it is this difference between the siblings that causes Zeus’s blatant favoritism. The fact that Athena is the embodiment of her father’s wisdom and craftiness, combined with Zeus’s egotistical pride that comes with birthing his own daughter, results in his favoritism of Athena to Ares.
Eventually, however, Zeus gives in to Ares’ pleas, but not without reminding Ares that he is appeasing him only out of obligation—“For thou art mine offspring, and it was to me that thy mother bare thee” (Hom. Il. 5.895). It is their biological connection—an unfortunate fact in Zeus’s eyes—that drives Zeus to help Ares. Again, he vehemently reminds Ares where he’d be without Zeus as his father: “But wert thou born of any other god, thus pestilent as thou art, then long ere this hadst thou been lower than the sons of heaven” (Hom. Il. 5.897). By harshly degrading his son, Zeus makes it very clear that Athena is still his favorite—she would never be threatened with being “lower than the sons of heaven”. Maybe it is Ares’s petulance that makes him so widely detested, or perhaps Zeus merely fears being superseded; regardless, Zeus ignores patriarchal norms and ennobles Athena. Despite his filial obligation to Ares, Zeus shares a unique relationship with his favorite daughter.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Plato, in his work Phaedo, provides a view on Greek afterlife that is radically different from the contemporary view at the time. Right from the beginning, it is clear to see that Plato’s view of the afterlife includes the notion of judgment, reward, and punishment for deeds done while alive. For most of the Greeks, this idea of judgment in the afterlife was not commonly accepted. By including the idea that reward exists in the afterlife, Plato, through his myth, inspires his disciples to focus more on improving their lives and putting effort into leading a more distinguished life. Because of the idea of judgment in the afterlife, Plato offers an alternative to the idea that actions in life have no implications, and shows that people in fact cannot live freely and do whatever they want. The following idea that provides a possibility to repent for sins and improve one’s life in the afterlife creates an important parallel and example for people to follow while still alive. If certain people can change their lives’ outcome in the afterlife, then surely they can work to improve their lives in the mortal world. Nevertheless, Plato advocates for people to live good lives in general, rather than live a meaningless life and try to atone in the underworld. Ideally for Plato, repentance in the underworld is a path taken only by people who did not live either distinguished or extremely sinful lives. However, even in light of the possibility for repentance, Plato subtly warns people to control themselves and refrain from committing serious crimes, because he states that even these people cannot be saved in the underworld. This view of the afterlife shares some parallels with the idea of the final judgment, repentance, and afterlife in Christianity. One important difference to note however is the idea that in Christianity, people can redeem themselves in the living world and afterlife, whereas Plato’s myth only offers the prospect of redemption in the afterlife to people whose lives were neither distinguished nor extremely sinful. Also, Plato’s idea of the ascension of the holy strongly reminds us of the ascension to heaven after life in Christianity. Although this view of the afterlife is separate from the more commonly accepted Greek view, it serves to teach lessons to be considered while alive. As is the nature with philosophers, Plato uses a theoretical extended explanation of the underworld in order to illustrate complicated phenomena to mortals, helping give concrete explanations through abstract concepts. By writing an explanation of death with many parallels to what occurs in life, Plato also helps people conceptualize ideas that they may otherwise have difficulty imagining. Therefore, Plato’s explanation serves many different functions, even though it does not embody the most common view of the underworld and afterlife of the time.

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">In the myth of Apollo and Daphne in Ovid’s *Metamorphoses*, the unfulfilled relationship between Apollo and Daphne demonstrates the inherent untamable nature of adolescence in the Greek consciousness. Marriage, a symbol of maturity, is unattainable for Apollo and completely foreign to Daphne, signifying that at this stage they are not prepared for more responsibility.
An important representation of Apollo that exemplifies his role as the archetypal youth is his failure to attain Daphne’s love. Although Apollo does father many children, he never actually marries and this indicates that he has not fully matured. Ovid makes it clear that this chase is more than a physical relationship; even after Daphne has been transformed Apollo refers to her as his would-be bride. In multiple instances, Ovid describes Phoebus’ longing and pursuit for love in terms of animalistic desire. Daphne, the “lamb,” “timid faun,” and “trembling dove,” clearly does not want Apollo’s attention as a “raging wolf,” “lion,” or “greyhound.” In particular Apollo becomes so determined he is described as “impetuous” and “almost fastens in her side his fangs.” Daphne is represented in a virtuous light that reflects her virgin innocence while Apollo acts like a wild predator. These characteristics of Apollo can be attributed more generally to all young men as an illustration of their lustful desires. The contrast between Daphne’s innocence and Apollo’s carnal desire emphasizes the strength of his feelings as well as the adolescent, wanton manner with which he chases her. The fact that Apollo is not successful in his chase points to the Greek idea of his youth and the overall perception of youth as an unrestricted force. This dictates an understanding of Greek adolescence as a period marked by wild and unrestrained actions, which would be acceptable in their society until marriage.
Daphne, by being a devoted follower of Artemis, also indicates the importance of virginity and youth on the female side of this Greek expectation. In shunning the idea of marriage, Daphne solidifies her place as a virgin and as a representative of Artemis. In response to her father’s desire for a son, Daphne even “hung her head to hide her shame” as an indicator of her devote virginity. The role of Daphne, furthermore, emphasizes the Greek image of the unmarried girl through her wild description of “bright hair waving on her neck” that Apollo wishes to be “properly arranged.” Daphne belongs to the open influences of nature, which brings a connotation of wilderness and further symbolizes the land in which unmarried girls belong, unable to be tamed by a husband. Although Daphne’s desires in this myth are completely opposite those of Apollo, their inherent characteristics are indicative of their youth in the stage of life right before marriage. Ultimately, Apollo’s intentions to make Daphne his bride are thwarted by her decision to worship Artemis through chastity, keeping Apollo in his youthful state and strengthening the Greek identity of untamed and wild girls.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Ovid&apos;s rendition of the love Apollo (here referred to by his epithet, Phoebus) has for Daphne demonstrates, among other significant mythological themes, Apollo’s status as a god of young unmarried men, and the necessity of Greek and Roman women to assume the roles of wives and mothers.
The myth begins with Apollo ridiculing Eros and his arrows of love. In Greek society, part of becoming a mature man is choosing a wife and making love to conceive a successor. However, Apollo admits that the feelings Eros incites with his arrows are “fires too subtle for [his] thought” (Ov. Met. 1.471). He is too young to understand love, and therefore dismisses it. Eros, however, decides to teach him a lesson, and Apollo feels the sting of first love as any young man coming of age would.
Meanwhile Daphne, struck with an arrow that prevented her from loving anyone, vowed herself a virgin. Young women in Greek and Roman society, before becoming wives were seen as belonging to her father. As such, Daphne must ask her father’s permission to “let [her] live/ a virgin always, for remember Jove/ did grant it to Diana at her birth.” (Ov. Met. 1.508-510) Daphne can only continue as a virgin when her father grants her the privilege, because in his eyes, and the eyes of their society, she “[owes] a grandchild” (Ov. Met. 1.503) in her duty as a woman.
However, the myth shows that there is something problematic in both their situations. As a mortal, Daphne cannot remain a virgin without disturbing the natural order of generations. Therefore, she is not simply allowed to remain an undisturbed virgin, but must have “her loveliness [prevail] against their will.” (Ov. Met. 1.512) She is pursued by the embodiment of young men himself, Apollo.
The chief of Daphne and Apollo&apos;s relationship, therefore, is comprised of the chase that is a vital element of youth: &quot;One / with hope pursued, the other fled in fear.&quot; (Ov. Met. 1.525-552) The role of the young female is described as &quot;the frightened hare... his prey&quot; (Ov. Met. 1.525-552) which shows the belief of the nature of a young woman as a wild creature that needs to be caught into domestic life.
Apollo, however, as the embodiment of young men, cannot be allowed to take the next step in love and pursue matrimony. Then he would become the head of a household and be burdened with the responsibilities and expectations of a mature man. Because of this, his love for Daphne can never be reciprocated.
The ending of the tale is able to conclude their chase without compromising the Greek ideals in question. Apollo feels Eros’ arrow acutely, but is never able to achieve his lover and forfeit his young man status. Daphne is unable to remain a virgin forever as a mortal human, but is instead transformed into a tree, as which she can retain her chastity.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">This excerpt in the Hymn to Dionysus exemplifies Dionysus’s attributes as a divinity who embodies contradictory ideas of youth and old-age, sobriety and drunkenness, sanity and madness, and kindness and meanness. He is first described as a young man, but one who shows signs of manhood. True to his wild and unexpected nature, he appears alone at a headland by the shore, a natural and uncivilized environment. Although the Tyrsenian pirates take notice of the god as they are traveling on “a well-decked ship” over “the sparkling sea”, they unwittingly sail towards their own “miserable doom.” The pirates then reveal their barbaric qualities as Thracians and proceed to tie Dionysus up. Naturally, they fail, not only because Dionysus is divine, but also because he is the Eleutherios, the liberator; so, it is ironic that the pirates would try to subjugate a deity who represents freedom. One of the helmsmen quickly realizes what they have done and immediately warns the others, but to no avail; he is instead mocked and called a Madman. Another irony appears here, since the other sailors will truly become mad while this helmsman’s “madness” will keep him safe. Soon after, the mortals face their punishment for attempting to overpower a god; they have gone against Themis. This disruption of order brings out Dionysus’s chaotic and destructive side as Bacchus: he makes it so that wine and ivy-plants spread throughout the ship, so that the sailors become intoxicated with frenzy. The god of wine does not stop with taking over the sailors’ bodies and transforms into a lion and creates a huge bear to attack the pirates. As his epithet Bromios suggests, he roars loudly, and finally seizes the master of the pirates. The other sailors, overwhelmed by fear and madness, leap out overboard and change into dolphins, signifying the transition between life and death; only the wise helmsman who recognized Dionysus’s divinity is spared. This display of kindness reveals that that Dionysus has a duality similar to that of wine, which he used to engulf the ship: wine can make people experience either joy or pain, depending on how well it is used; likewise, Dionysus will bring happiness to those who follow his ways and bring brutality to those who disobey and goes against him.</chars>

These maenads are wonderful indicators of how Dionysus was worshipped, showing the wild nature and passionate dancing customary to the cult. A main quality of Dionysiac worship was the idea of leaving the realm of the acceptable and acting in a manner antithetical to social norms and customs. This behavior explains why Dionysus was worshipped outside the city and mostly by women. In Greek society, women were subordinate to men, and thus when they left to worship Dionysus in this wild and unkempt manner, they showed a complete departure from social norms and an entrance into a different level of consciousness. The other images on this kylix also provide evidence about the worship and cult of Dionysus. The grapevines, satyrs, and thyrsus are all characteristics of the cult of Dionysus, providing symbols that can easily be associated with the cult. The grapevine is a symbol of Dionysus because he is the god of wine. The satyrs and the thyrsus also are symbols of the cult because they portray what and who were involved in worship. Additionally, on the second kylix, the Maenads are dancing around a statue of Dionysus. This practice was common in ancient Greece, and even though there was just a statue, the maenads believed that Dionysus inhabited it, and thus worshipped the statue as the god. This dance illustrates how Dionysiac worship took over one’s body and spirit. Although the third vessel does not have similar images to the first, it also is telling about the nature of Dionysus. The image of Dionysus and Heracles shows the dual nature of both deities. Both started out mortal and then were transformed into immortal gods. Thus, because Dionysus was both mortal and immortal, dead and alive, one can see his dual nature in this depiction. Also interesting about the depiction of these two characters is the connection to the wild natures of both. Dionysus in his very nature is untamed, and so is his worship. Heracles, with his brute strength is wild in a different kind of way, as his strength is too much for a normal human being. He is a hero that accomplishes tasks, but only can do so with his unkempt strength, also performing these tasks outside the city and away from social norms. On the inside of this third vessel, the clusters of grapes and the people at a symposium connect everything back to Dionysus and his worship through wine. Through drinking, dancing, and the total release of structure, we learn that Dionysiac worship is something on a different level of consciousness than normal worship, and the way people connected to this god was through a form of madness, induced by wine and sustained by spirit.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Euripedes’ play *Alcestis* paints a distinct picture of the relationship between Fate, Death, and the Hero in the Greek psyche. The play focuses on Heracles’ heroic rescue of Alcestis from the clutches of death. Overcoming death is a common factor that defines many heroes of Greek mythology. *Alcestis* demonstrates Heracles’ heroic status by featuring his defeat of Death. To the ancient Greeks, Fate and death were the inescapable conclusion to mortal life. In his soliloquy at the beginning of the play, Apollo articulates this orthodox view of an unconquerable Death, foreshadowing Heracles’ actions later in the play. He seeks to “to avoid the pollution of death in the house” (22). Referring to death as a pollution implies that it cannot be escaped, death has infested the house and cannot be stopped. Now is Alcestis’ hour “for it is on this day that she is fated to die” (21). And on that fateful day “He [Death] has arrived punctually, watching for today when she must die” (27). Alcestis’ death is as unavoidable as her fate in the eyes of the Greeks. Once your time has come, there is no turning back, no other course of action. To the Greeks, Death and Fate are omnipotent and unconquerable. Admetus himself says, “It is not possible for the dead to come back to the light,” (1077) just before his wife is revealed to him. To overcome Death is to accomplish the impossible. Of course, the definition of a hero is one who accomplishes such feats. Many Greeks heroes have had brushes with Death and with the underworld, including Orpheus, Odysseus, and Heracles. When Heracles overcomes Death and brings Alcestis back to the world of the living, he is affirming his status as a hero. Heracles “fought the divinity who controlled her&quot; [1141], accomplishing the impossible, defeating Death. Death is more than just another labor or monster to slay, by nature Death is unquestionable, unconquerable. Death is the most impossible of tasks. He is able to bring Alcestis “back to the light” because as the arguable greatest of heroes, he can accomplish the most impossible task, defying death and bringing Alcestis back to the land of the living.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Sophocles’ Antigone, he describes how Eurydice learns from the messenger that her son, Haemon, attempted to kill his father Creon, after Haemon saw that his fiancé, Antigone, had taken her own life. Haemon then also commits suicide. The messenger describes how he and Creon “… turned away to enter the maiden’s stoney-bedded bridal chamber, the caverned mansion of Hades’ bride.” By choosing these words to describe the cave where Creon and the messenger found Antigone and Haemon, Sophocles is drawing a parallel between Antigone and Persephone, Hades’ wife.
To start, both girls are associated with caves. Antigone is buried alive in a cave by her uncle, Creon, as punishment for burying her brother’s body. Sophocles hints that Persephone and Antigone are similar by calling this cave, “the caverned mansion of Hades’ bride.” Persephone, too, essentially “dies” in a cave. One of Hades’ epithets is an axe that he uses to cleave the earth and create a cave as an entrance to the Underworld so Persephone, and others, can enter. When Persephone eats the pomegranate seeds, the fruit of the Underworld, she too “dies” in a cave.
In addition, Persephone was a kore, a young unmarried girl. Since Persephone technically “died” when she entered the Underworld, she was able to remain kore when she married Hades. Antigone, too, remained a kore. Although Antigone was engaged to Haemon, they did not marry before she committed suicide. Sophocles writes after Haemon stabs himself that, “corpse enfolding corpse he lay, having won his marriage rites, poor boy, not here, but in Hades’ palace.” Therefore Heamon and Antigone are very similar to Persephone and Hades in that they both had to “die” before they could be married. Both girls managed to be both a kore and wife.
Furthermore, both young girls were daughters of royalty. Antigone was the daughter of the ill-fated king, Oedipus; and Persephone was the daughter of the king of the gods, Zeus.
Finally, both Antigone and Persephone took their destiny into their own hands and had rather tragic “deaths”. Antigone knew that if she went against Creon’s orders and buried Polyneices that she would have to suffer the consequences. Antigone decided that she would rather die than let her brother be wronged. Persephone too decided her own destiny. Depending on the version of the myth one chooses to believe, Persephone ate the pomegranate seeds because Hades tricked her or because she was desperately hungry. Either way, although it was not a conscious decision like Antigone’s, Persephone too decided her own fate when she ate the seeds.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">This myth is one interpretation of the genealogy of Athens, with a demonstration of characteristic attributes of Athena, as well as reinforcing the negative views on women held by Greek society. The characters listed in the beginning of the myth coincide with the names of earlier kings of Athens. It also furthers the connection between Athens and the Goddess of its namesake, Athena.
The story of the birth of Erichthonius further establishes the virginity of Athena, as well as giving the Athenian royalty a connection to the divine. When Hephaestus pursues Athena, she, “being a chaste virgin, would not submit to him,” reinforcing her resistance to the sexual pursuits of men, letting the seed he spilled on her drop “in disgust”. However, Erichthonius still manages to claim divine lineage, as when “the seed fell on the ground, Erichthonius was produced.” Despite Athena being a virgin Goddess and therefore unable to bear children, in order to establish a connection between Athena and Athens, Erichthonius is brought up by Athena. Thus, he can be claimed as “a son of Hephaestus and Athena”.
Athena raised Erichthonius in secret to ensure that the belief in her chastity was unquestioned, and once he reached a certain age, was given up to the care of the sisters of Pandrosus. We see that like Pandora, the women in this story are negative forces, as they often are in mythology. They are unable to keep their word to Athena, with short-sighted impulsiveness commit an act that was “forbidden”. Within the chest, they “beheld a serpent coiled around a babe,” the representation of Athena protecting one who would become the ruler of her city. They were punished for this violation, “driven mad by reason of the anger of Athena, and threw themselves down from the acropolis,” unable to retain rationality and continue their mortal lives having witnessed a divine secret.
Erichthonius, having been both born of divine seed and raised by divine care, has a more legitimate claim to the Athenian throne than Amphictyon, one who seized it for himself. Being raised by Athena meant that he was nurtured and taught in the ways of wisdom and order, which Athena embodies with several of her epithets, particularly Athena Polias, to whom he builds a temple on the acropolis. Therefore Erichthonius’ reclamation of the throne of Athens represented another example of the triumph of civilized order exemplified by the Olympian gods. Erichthonius then marries “Praxithea, a Naiad nymph,” which unites him with the land he rules, giving him ownership over it in the same way a Greek man has ownership over his wife.
Lastly the myth acknowledges the importance of reverence towards the Gods by having Erichthonius put in place several dedications to Athena. He exemplifies the gratitude every citizen should have towards the Goddess who aided him in his journey to power and prosperity. It also explains the origin of an important religious relic in place in Athens and one of the largest festivals in the region.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">The Homeric Hymn to Dionysus is one that fully encapsulates the power of the Gods while giving the reader further understanding of who Dionysus is as a character in Greek Mythology. Dionysus’s most noted characteristic is that he is the God of Wine. This characteristic is illuminated in order to give the reader a better sense of the God’s almighty power. The hymn does an extraordinary job of explaining how he uses his powers to his advantage by flooding the ship with wine and having vines grapple the sales and wrap around the ship. This imagery that is delivered to the reader gives one a sense of how mortals are nothing but puppets in the hands of the Gods. All in all, the hymn is yet another example how Gods in Greek mythology have the capability of determining the lives of mortals. When challenged, Dionysus gave mercy to the man he felt deserved mercy and punished those who he felt deserved to be punished. Dionysus fully determined the outcome of the situation while exemplifying his divine powers that make him a God.
Interestingly, the helmsmen, who witnesses Dionysus’ overbearing power when breaking out of the bonds the shipmen tried to tie him with, mistakes Dionysus for Zeus, Apollo and Poseidon simply due to the strength of Dionysus. This shows the reader that although Dionysus isn’t considered to be of the same caliber God as Zeus, Apollo or Poseidon, he is still a God and obtains unimaginable power in the mind of a human.
Another example of Dionysus determining the lives of everyone in the myth is when Dionysus turns into a lion and releases a bear on to the ship forcing all the men, except the helmsmen, to abandon ship. This scene further exemplifies the capabilities of the immortals in Greek Mythology. Dionysus then proceeds to turn the men who jumped ship into dolphins, giving them mercy while changing their figure. Most interestingly, it seems as though Dionysus does nothing but give gratitude to the helmsmen for recognizing that he was a God thus making Dionysus gracious for the recognition. Dionysus, once being challenged by the crew, exemplifies his power in such a way that forces the men of the ship to leave their ship, while keeping their leader of the ship and giving him mercy due to the fact that he was trying to stop his shipmen for mistaking the mysterious man in a purple robe.
The gods’ ability to determine the lives of mortals is a common theme seen throughout Greek Mythology. This hymn exemplifies how Gods who aren’t of the same status as Zeus, Apollo or Poseidon are still immortal and still obtain far superior power then those born as humans.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">This passage from the Odyssey gives an insight into man’s perception of the gods and reveals how the immortals’ idiosyncrasies and transgressions teach timeless lessons about human weakness, the art of deception, and the power of forgiveness. The minstrel’s song about the adulterous affair between Ares and Aphrodite shows that the gods suffer from human foibles and shortcomings. Like man, the gods are held accountable for their actions and must pay a hefty price when they succumb to temptation or recklessness. Even in the realm of the gods there is a moral code that must be followed and boundaries that must not be crossed. Punishment awaits the wrongdoer. For their indiscretion, Ares and Aphrodite suffer indignity and humiliation as Hephaestus calls the other gods to witness the sight of them ensnared in his wily trap. The unfaithful lovers become the object of ridicule and “unquenchable laughter”.
In addition to exposing the transgressions of the immortals, the minstrel’s words reveal how appearances can deceive; things are not always as they seem. For example, Hephaestus although lame and “misshapen” proves too formidable an adversary for the mighty Ares. Hephaestus’s affinity for the island of Lemons highlights the god’s fickle, dichotomous nature. Lemnos is an island renowned not only for its beauty and temperate climate, but also for the occasional violent volcanic eruptions from the mountain of Mosychlos. Like Lemnos, Hephaestus can be calm and quiet, yet explosive and violent when angered or provoked. Fury fuels Hephaestus’s cunning so that the disabled and slow outmatch the abled and swift Ares. In this instance, guile overpowers brute strength.
While Ares and Aphrodite are justly punished for their illicit tryst, the song concludes with Poseidon interceding and asking Hephaestus to release them. It is not coincidental that the Phoenicians, expert mariners dependent on the sea for their livelihood, portray Poseidon as the most powerful and well-respected of the gods. Unlike the other immortals who scoff at the indiscretion of Aphrodite and Ares, Poseidon “laughs not”, as he recognizes that it is time to forgive .The wise Poseidon convinces Hephaestus to set the lovers free. While the minstrel’s song entertains, it more importantly offers a captivating glimpse into the nature of both man and the gods.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">In *Phaedo*, Plato outlines the underworld to depict its connection to the living and to illustrate that there is a strong sense of moral behavior on which the Greeks based their society.
The Stygian river is described to encircle other waters and finally pour into Tartarus, creating an image of the afterlife permeating the entire world. This suggests the great extent to which the underworld affects the living world and shows that the Greeks understand death as a passage into further life, rather than as an end to life. Plato describes that those who “have excelled in holy living” and have fulfilled their duties can “mount upward into their pure abode and dwell upon the earth” (114b). It is important here that the transition between realms is done with such ease, indicating the close linkage between life and death. Even with death, souls are able to return to earth when their sins have been repaid. This idea lends itself to the Greek belief that there is a continual cycle of existence between opposite realms.
As a major aspect of this cycle, Plato emphasizes the importance of moral goodness in order to move forward. The judgment that every person must go through after death creates a distinction between those who pass onto peaceful “still more beautiful abodes,” those who must absolve themselves, and those who are undoubtedly condemned to Tartarus. The dead who are guilty of moral transgressions are given the opportunity to pay penance for their sins by traveling to the lake from Acheron, exhibiting that the Greeks believe in redemption for wrongdoings. This second chance, however, can only be extended so far as Plato indicates people who have committed “great deeds of sacrilege, or wicked and abominable murders” are sent to Tartarus forever. This same severity of fate is demonstrated in the myths of Tantalus, Sisyphus, and Ixion who are forever taunted by their punishments in ways representative of their atrocious crimes. These three exemplify the negative fate that can encompass the afterlife if a man defies the gods or does not act in accord with “themis.” This outline of judgment in the underworld allows man to understand the possibility of eternal torture if they do not respect the gods or if they act unethically with their peers.
Plato sums up his telling of the underworld passage by saying “we ought to do our best to acquire virtue and wisdom in life. For the prize is fair and the hope great.” Such a rewarding fate is only available to those who live well in Greek society, encouraging people to be morally good in their life so they can have an equally good afterlife. The relationship between the underworld and the living, both through physical transitions and moral direction, shows us the importance that Greeks placed on behavior in accordance with “themis” as well as their belief of the intricate perpetuation of existence.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Because Dionysios represents many different ideas in Greek culture as the “the god of everything and its opposite,” this myth embraces many of Dionysos’ key epithets. From Dionysos the reveler to Dionysos the savior, his widespread personalities are found in this passage.
First, his surname *Mystes* is appropriate here, as most of this passage deals with the sailors’ confusion with the miracles this strange deity produces onboard. Sailors assume an angry god on the ocean would “stir up dangerous winds and heavy squalls,” as the helmsman fears, not grow ivy up the mast. The sailors’ uncertainty concurs with the worship of Dionysos in general. He is known as the god who arrives; Dionysos and everything he stands for is foreign to Greek thought. Since much of what Dionysos represents is seen as crazed and untamed, characteristics opposite of the order of the Greek world, some find it hard to pay homage to this new god. Yet since he is an Olympian, according to Themis he must be honored, and thus the Greek Themis needs to be broken in order to be maintained.
Corresponding to his wild and loud nature, *Bromios*, an epithet referring to Dionysos’ tendency for arriving with pomp and his penchant for loud revelries, makes sense as well here. The purple color of his robe, the creation of a veritable vineyard onboard the ship, and the addition of a “shaggy bear” are all flashy ways of proving himself to the sailors. Dionysos himself turns into a lion, the real *Bromios*, or “roarer.” As the god who arrives, he always arrives with flare.
Because he is the god of revelries, Dionysos is also the god of the drink that makes men revel. Since wine is one of the most defining characteristics of Dionysos’ persona, and is included in many of his epithets, the creation of a “sweet, fragrant wine” makes sense as the way he reveals himself to mortals. The wine flowing throughout the ship and the lush ivy with “rich berries” and flowers he creates on the “fruitless sea” also demonstrate Dionysos’ predominance in fertility, another characteristic of the “god of everything.”
Though most of Dionysos’ personalities are raucous and defy Themis, he has the demeanor of a normal Olympian when it comes to justice. In the last part of this myth, Dionysios spares the helmsman. Since he recognized Dionysos as a god, he “found favor” in Dionysos’ heart, leading Dionysos to play his role of *Lysius* or *Eleutherios*, the liberator or the releaser. Dionysos is not an inherently angry god, though to dole out justice he sometimes takes on the role of the punisher, as with Pentheus (Euripides, *Bacchae*). Here he shows he is a just god; he spares those who deserve to be spared.
This myth brings together many facets of Dionysos’ all-encompassing persona in a succinct portrait of the god, demonstrating his foreign nature, his connection to wine and fertility, his predilection for boisterousness, and also his role as a just Olympian.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Aeschylus’ *Suppliant Women* and the krater depicting the marriages of Thetis and Oreithyia tell stories of forced marriage. These two pieces, both of the fourth century B.C., clearly depict marriage as a forceful act, taking place without the consent of the bride (OCD, Aeschylus; Perseus, Boston1972.850). The play supports the female perspective, while the krater displays the dominant views of patriarchal society.
*Suppliant Women* sympathizes with the plight of the unwilling bride; a chorus of women flee to Argos, seeking protection from Egyptian men who intend to marry them against their will. Their father Danaus aids the women, advising them, “Count your chastity more precious than your life” (Aeschylus, *Suppliant Women*, 1010). Following this advice, the women insist repeatedly that they would rather be brides of Hades than married against their will. The women compare their tormented flight with that of Io, driven from country to country by the torment of a gadfly. Rather than concluding with the capture of the bride, Aeschylus’ play ends with the decision of Argos to protect the chorus, clearly taking the side of the female victim of marriage abduction.
The krater depicts two myths of forced marriage: Peleus’s capture of Thetis and the rape of Oreithyia by Boreas. The upper register shows Thetis in an attempt to escape her pursuer, Peleus, who grips her around her waste (Perseus). This scene recalls the myth in which Peleus grips the shape-shifter until she loses energy and he can claim his spent bride. On the back of the vase, the upper register depicts Thetis’ father, Nereus, watching blankly as his daughter is taken by force (Perseus).
The lower register of the krater shows the maiden Oreithyia fleeing before the winged figure of Boreas, the North Wind. Here, the krater depicts the moments leading up to the scene of Boreas’ rape of Oreithyia. Similar to the scene of the upper register, this depiction of Oreithyia’s unwilling marriage also includes the passive figure of her father, Erechtheus, watching his daughter’s attempt to escape her unwanted union (Perseus). Both registers of the krater depict myths in which women are taken in marriage against their will, unaided by their fathers who, unlike the sympathetic Danaus, allow the violent act to take place. This krater reflects a culture in which marriage by abduction is not only common, but condoned. Husbands pursue the virginal women, so often seen in Greek mythology as needing to be caught and tamed, while the father looking on gives clear, patriarchal approval to the event. In contrast to *Suppliant Women*, where the forceful husbands are foreigners, considered barbaric, violent, and even compared with pests in their relentless pursuit, here the myths feature a celebrated king and god, clearly placing favor on the male perspective.
Both the krater and *Suppliant Women* portray marriage as an act of male force upon the unwilling female, but while the play identifies with the feminine plight, the krater represents society’s support for the male aggressor.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">In the tenth “Pythian Ode,” Pindar extols the necessity of the gods to mortal accomplishments. Pindar does this in relation to the upcoming Pythian Games, where the best of the best of Greek men come to compete in sports tournaments. While lauding the merits of the gods and heroes in the tenth Pythian Ode, Pindar shows how ancient Greeks felt about the achievements of mortals and their dependence on the gods in order to make them happen.
Pindar starts the tenth Pythian Ode by mentioning how the cities of Lacedaemon and Thessaly are “prosperous” and “divinely blessed” (1) because the rulers of both cities are descendants of Heracles. This highlights the direct correlation Greeks saw between success and divine intervention. Pindar shows the importance of this correlation again when he speaks about Hippocleas, an athlete claimed to be one of the best of his time, who is about to go to the Pythian Games. The Pythian Games took place every eight years at Delphi, a place that was incredibly sacred to Apollo. Expanding on this theme of mortal’s dependence on divinities for greatness, Pindar says that “no doubt [Hippocleas] accomplished this [feat of being an outstanding athlete] with the help of your counsels,” (10) where “your” refers to Apollo. This quotation shows how Greeks did not believe it was possible to be that spectacular without the help of the gods. There are many tragic myths that depict mortals displaying hybris against the gods. These serve as warnings to Greeks to remember their limits: they can be good, but they will never be as good as the gods, even with divine intervention. Pindar in the tenth Pythian Ode acknowledges that the gods are necessary for mortal achievement.
Pindar also shows the limitations of mortal success in the tenth Pythian Ode when he says “A man is considered fortunate, and wise poets sing his praises, if he wins victory with his hands or the excellence of his feet. He can never set foot in the bronze heavens; but whatever splendor we mortals can attain, he reaches the limit of that voyage,” (25) The limitations of mortal achievement is shown here to be limited physically to the Earth, as mortals are unable to go to mythical lands such as Olympus and the Underworld without divine intervention. Pindar uses Perseus’ trip to the land of Hyperboreans as an example of mortal limitations in travel. As Pindar continues to list the accomplishments of the heroes and how they achieved these great feats, Pindar continually reminds the readers of their limitations.
The concept of mortal limitations in regards to the gods is very important to ancient Greek society, and Pindar in the tenth Pythian Ode gratuitously acknowledges the role the gods play in great mortal achievements.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">The myth of Narcissus is one which exemplifies the consequences of hubris, as well as those of breaking Themis. According to the source, many women sought the affections of Narcissus; yet, all were rejected by him. This is an act of hubris, yes—in that his “pride” forbid that any “[gain] his favour”—but it is more than that. As a young Greek male denying all females—thereby refusing to establish a household, raise a family, and take his place in society—Narcissus was not only committing an act of hubris, but he was also defying Themis.
Narcissus is not the only person in this myth to break Themis—for Echo broke Themis, too. Echo, by divulging the divine secrets of Hera, committed a crime against the gods and also broke Themis in that the secrets she told were not knowledge ever intended to reach human ears. For this crime she, like Narcissus, is punished with death. What’s more, as demonstrated by the fates of Narcissus and Echo, such violations against nature translate into being absorbed back into nature.
The fates of the pair, then, are also significant—just as significant, one might argue, as the crimes they committed. Both Narcissus and Echo commit crimes against the nature of the universe, yet, in the end, both are tethered to—and, ultimately, returned to—physical nature. When Narcissus dies, he is turned to a “sprite”; his body disappears and a flower takes its place. Echo, who similarly defies nature, is also returned to nature: it is said that “her bones have turned to stone”, and her voice “lives among the hills.”
Perhaps their metamorphosis can be explained in part by the fact that they are both inherently figments of nature. Echo herself is a nymph, a spirit of nature, and Narcissus is a sibling of Naiads, other spirits of nature, which would mean he himself has nature in his bloodline. Moreover, Narcissus’ death is mourned by the Naiads, Dryads, and Echo—all of whom are forces of nature. Though the pair has such strong connections to physical nature, to call them agents of nature would be erroneous; after all, they act in opposition to some of the core tenets of the nature of the universe. It is interesting, then, for, though what Narcissus and Echo do defies Themis, they are, ultimately, both returned to nature.
Though this resolution of the myth may seem contradictory, in reality, it makes sense. Arguably, the pairs’ fates are enacted as means of appeasing Themis for their crimes; not only do they receive the punishment of death, but they are returned to the earth itself. It is justice twofold, both literally and symbolically. As the two both committed crimes against order—one kind of nature—they are united with physical nature, the landscape itself being an agent of order. Ultimately, they must submit to the order of nature in penance for their defiance of the nature of order.

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">In his Antigone, Sophocles creates a tragic story that not only reveals the importance of honoring the dead, but also symbolically depicts the gods that reign over this realm.
Antigone is the focus of this connection, as her journey and struggles parallel those of Persephone herself.
Throughout the play, Antigone, like Persephone, is portrayed as being the Kore who is destined to marry death. Antigone, daughter of Oedipus the king, is an unmarried maiden who is engaged to
the heir of the throne. Persephone too is the unmarried daughter of a king, Zeus, but more importantly, she is depicted as the Kore because she will forever be the unmarried maiden. Persephone does in fact marry Hades, but because she marries Death, she essentially dies and is preserved as the Kore for all time. And like Persephone, Antigone too is prophesied to marry death. Creon, who does not want his son to marry Antigone, remarks that “Death is the one who will end these bridals for me” (575). Moreover, he tells Haemon that he “can never marry her, not while she is still alive” (750) and to “let her go find a husband in Hades” (655). But perhaps most tellingly, Antigone herself remarks that her “life has long been in Death&apos;s hands so that [she] might serve the dead” (559-60). It almost seems thats Antigone is directly comparing herself to Persephone, as Persephone is very much under Hades&apos; control so that she might help him serve the dead. Antigone and Creon both recognize that she, the unmarried bride-to-be, will not be wedded to Haemon, but to Death.
The events that transpire towards the end of the play symbolize Persephone&apos;s own journey to the underworld. After Creon decides that Antigone is to be executed, she is led away from the palace with a procession of attendants taking her to the cave where she will die. However, this execution march seems more like a bridal procession: during this journey, Antigone says, “I have not had my due portion of the chant that brings the bride, nor has any hymn been mine for the crowning of marriage. Instead the lord of Acheron will be my groom” (813-816). She is not going to her death, but going unwillingly to her wedding with Death, and eventually, Antigone is led to her “tomb, [and] bridal-chamber” (891). Haemon manages to get inside the tomb only to find Antigone hanging by linen threads. After attacking Creon, he finally kills himself, clasping Antigone&apos;s corpse as gasped his last breath. With his death, Haemon, “having won his marriage rites .. not [there], but in Hades&apos; palace” ultimately gives Antigone the dead groom that both Creon and Antigone knew she was destined to wed.
While there are various discrepancies between Antigone&apos;s and Persephone&apos;s stories, the Antigone illustrates the Persephone myth with mortal characters. The mortality of these characters gives new shape to the myth, as Antigone will not be returning from the underworld, bringing the spring with her.</chars>

Ovid’s description of the myth of Apollo and the nymph Daphne asserts the triumph of emotional over physical power. In the first sentence of the myth, Ovid states “Daphne…was first beloved by Phoebus.” Other translations of the work state that Daphne “was the first love of Great Apollo”, indicating that he had not been exposed to the power of emotion or love. The story starts when Apollo confronts Eros, insulting him for his archery talents that can’t even draw an enemy’s blood, claiming that his prowess with the sport is clearly superior for its ability to cause physical injury. “The bow is only for the use of those large deities of heaven whose strength may deal wounds, mortal, to the savage beasts of prey,” Apollo says, belittling Eros, “leave me to the glory that is mine.” Through this insult, Apollo is neglecting Eros’ own powers which are emotionally focused rather than physically. Apollo has never been affected by emotion and is over-emphasizing the importance of brute strength and the ability to cause physical harm to an enemy. Eros refutes his claims, stating that “thy glory is less than mine,” and sets out to get his revenge by forcing Apollo to feel the pangs of unrequited love. By making Apollo chase the woman he loves, catch her, and then lose her again when she fades into nature as the laurel tree, Eros makes Apollo experience wounds that are not of flesh and blood, but of the heart and more abstract emotions through unrequited love. In the literal chase that ensues between Apollo and Daphne, Apollo has a lengthy monologue in which he tries to convince Daphne to stop running, comparing their running to a predator chasing prey. Apollo says that “all hasten from their natural enemy but I alone pursue for my dear love”, indicating that he is beginning to realize the limits to his hunting arrows that inflict physical wounds and are powerless in this chase of emotions. At the conclusion of the monologue, Apollo clearly admits to the power of Eros, even stating that it is much more powerful than his own. “My bow is certain, but a flaming shaft surpassing mine has pierced my heart- untouched before… there is no herb to medicate my wound, and all the arts that save have failed their lord.” He recognizes that though his arrows can pierce the skin and draw blood, such wounds will eventually heal. However, the wounds that Eros’ superior arrows inflict are abstract and internal, untouched by the powers of medicine and healing that Apollo already knows so well. Wounds of emotion and unrequited love will never heal, as shown when Apollo adopts the laurel leaves as an enduring symbol of his devotion to the girl. In adopting the laurel as his symbol, Apollo is essentially admitting to the superiority of Eros’ emotional strength over his own physical capacities that though powerful are not as enduring.

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">The nymph Daphne represents the chaotic and wild nature of women. She spurned Apollo’s advances after Cupid struck Apollo with a golden arrow of desire and Daphne with a black arrow of detest. As she was running away, she cried out for help and her father, a river god, turned her into a willow tree. Women in Roman society were considered to be troublesome and wild. Daphne, however, is not just an ordinary Roman woman - she is a nymph. In many ways, nymphs are extreme representations of women’s troublesome and chaotic dispositions. As a nymph, Daphne is an attractive female spirit of nature. Generally, nymphs are considered to be predatory in nature – desiring young men. Nymphs primarily cause trouble by stealing away attractive young men. However, due to Cupid’s arrow Daphne is different. Instead of being the hunter, she is the hunted. In Roman society, women must be captured and civilized by marriage. This is represented through Apollo’s chase of Daphne. For Daphne though, the idea of marriage “seemed criminal”(Ov. Met. 1.505). Instead of being free, she would be forced to relinquish herself to the control of her husband. Marriage appears to be more of a punishment than a blessing for her. Therefore, Daphne will not give herself to Apollo, but she will to his twin, Artemis. She asked her father to allow her to remain a virgin, therefore committing herself to Artemis – the virgin goddess. Artemis is also considered to be wild and savage towards those who anger her, signifying that other virgin women have chaotic and wild temperaments. As Daphne is running from Apollo, she begs her father to “change the body that destroys my life&quot;(Ov. Met, 1.590). She views the maturation of her body, a signal that she is ready to be married, as the end of her true existence as a free spirit. Her father hears her cries and transforms her into a willow tree so she can remain wild and untamed forever. Apollo, on the other hand, is destined to never catch and marry Daphne. Apollo is a Korous, an unmarried male youth. The capture of Daphne would have symbolized Apollo’s growth into a mature man. This association is even stronger since Daphne is considered to be Apollo’s first love. Even after Daphne is changed into a tree, Apollo still declares that even if she cannot be his bride, she will “be called my chosen tree”(Ov. Met. 1.606). In some ways, Apollo does capture Daphne by taking some of her leaves and creating a laurel crown that he wears around his head. The crown symbolizes his status as a Korous as well as Daphne’s wild nature because the willow tree represents her everlasting virginity and therefore her chaotic and uncontrollable spirit. Daphne truly does represent the wild and chaotic disposition of Roman women.

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Plato&apos;s depiction of the Underworld, discussed also in his &quot;Republic&quot;, demonstrates the process of judgment in the afterlife. Plato’s illustration of Hades was commonly accepted, and is the model used in Dante’s Inferno. The necessity of mapping the underworld stems from the seafaring nature of the Greeks. In life, they were familiar with their immediate geography; a desire to comprehend the geography of the world after death is an understandable yearning. Furthermore, the unique geography of Hades facilitates the complex process of judgment upon death.
Plato describes the path of individuals as they traverse the underworld: those who are evil in life are punished in a fitting manner (parallel to Dante’s Inferno, exemplified by Tantalus (Hom. Od., 584-590)). Plato states that “when the dead have come to the place where each if led by his genius, first they are judged and sentenced, as they have lived well and piously, or not” (113d). This line is curious for two reasons. First, that the ‘genius’ of man leads them to their fate; the word choice here is nearly sardonic, for men often act on their hubris, leading them to sin against themis and suffer for it terribly. Secondly, that the judgment is dichotomous, a man has either “lived well…or not” (113d). This bifurcation in judgment is extremely strict, but plays into the Greek mindset of divine will as supreme against human will, akin to the ability of the Christian God to smite.
Reference is made to the “judges” (Minos, Rhadamanthys, Aecus (class discussion)), who determine the fate of each person as they enter the realm. Those who have defied themis, such as “committed great sins” (113e), are thrown into Tartarus for one year prior to judging, thrown into various rivers based on the degree of sin. After one year, “the wave casts them out” (114a), and this process repeats itself until “they prevail upon those whom they have wronged” (114b). The concept of forgiveness in death mirrors that of purification for defying themis in life, such as Heracles serving penance for murdering his children. Thus there is a cycle of judgment, borne through the water cycle of the underworld. A curious aspect of the Platonic illustration of the Realm of Hades is the presence of the four rivers, Styx, Cocytus, Pyriphlegethon, and Acheron, each with a symbolic meaning. Water, the source of all life, is an integral component of the arena of death.
Opposite those who have grievously sinned are those who have “duly purified themselves by philosophy” (114c), an interesting addition by Plato, who himself was a philosopher. The importance of philosophy, one of the highest forms of intellectual practice, was pertinent to the Greeks as a democratic, forum-frequenting society.
Plato’s objectives are threefold. First, to sketch the geographical structure of the underworld; second, to forewarn mortals of their inevitable death and necessity of pursuing righteous, non-sinning lives; and third, to promote philosophy and acquisition of wisdom, a primary passion of Plato’s.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Plato’s *Phaedo* showcases the widespread belief in ancient Greece that underground sources of water, especially flowing water, had inherent purifying and metamorphic properties. Describing the bodies of water that constitutes Hades, Phaedo demonstrates that the only place where souls can be altered is defined by intersecting rivers and lakes. Here is where souls are said to undergo transformations, from receiving short-lived punishments to reclaim their purity or endless torture without salvation. Various actions are constantly being performed within Hades, which are symbolized by the eternally flowing waters.
Those who have lived a moderately pious life are taken to one of the upper lakes, where “they dwell and are purified” to attain ultimate refinement of their soul. The state in which they arrive in the Underworld is an in-between condition, where they are not fundamentally evil, but have transgressed enough times in their life to make their current spirit unpredictable. To “dwell” in the lake coincides with the state of flux their soul resides in, and after enough time they emerge transformed into their purest state of being.
Those who have committed greater atrocities, but are still “curable,” have a chance to reform and are sent to Tartarus for a year until a “wave casts them out” and they are “brought by the current to the Acherusian lake.” The violent motion of the wave is necessary to absolve more prevalent offenses, while the constant back-and-forth flow between the lake and the river until they “prevail” emphasizes that a proportional amount of cleansing must occur for the extent to which a soul was corrupted. The extent to which one’s sins were rooted within themselves determined the amount of effort required to convert them from an impure to a pure state.
The resulting souls, whether they are “those who are found to have excelled in holy living” before judgment or have already been purged by the waters in Hades “are freed from these regions.” This ability for a soul to transcend the eternally flowing waters of a place below the ground to “mount upward” onto the solid earth exemplifies the ultimate transformation. In order for the dead to be pardoned (if at all, dependant on how bad their faults were while alive) they are brought to a place completely separated from the realm of the living. Before a soul has reached a completely clean state, they are tossed around between rivers and lakes, always in some sort of motion. This flow of water is reminiscent of washing an object, where it enters the water dirty and emerges looking like a totally different object after the grime and soil has been scrubbed off. When the nature of the soul is determined to be flawless, the soul is discharged from the turbulent waters to the stable ground above. There is no need to undergo anymore changes at that place, as it is a “pure abode” and therefore encompasses those with perfected morals that will not change again.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">The ancient myth of Apollo and Daphne informs us of valued traits in Greek society through the interaction of Apollo and Cupid. The story promotes modesty and cunning, rather than arrogance and brawn. Apollo vanquishes the Python, and feels very proud of his accomplishment. He sees Cupid with his bow and arrows soon afterwards, and suggests that Cupid is not powerful enough to wield such weapons. (Ovid 1.461-1.462) Apollo informs Cupid that only the most powerful gods (such as him) can possess them, and that Cupid’s arrows are only good for kindling. (Ovid 1.463 – 1.464) Such condescension has no place in civilized society and is completely unprecedented. Who is Apollo to criticize Cupid, another equally powerful god? This behavior echoes Apollo’s traits of a young man, who are often more arrogant than their place in society allows. Cupid will punish Apollo for his indiscretion, putting him back in his place.
This interaction reflects the importance of modesty in Greek culture. Arrogance will leave a person disliked by his neighbors, and will often have unintended consequences. Also, although the Greeks highly valued athleticism, cunning is clearly just as important. Violence and strength alone cannot conquer formidable opponents; one has to think strategically and intelligently. (This concept is also reflected within Ares and Athena; the former represents pure violence and is not well liked, whereas the latter represents intelligent war strategy and is beloved.)
Cupid responds to Apollo’s insults with direct action (another valued trait in Greek society). Although Cupid did not instigate this conflict he will triumph because he effectively acts on his opinions, rather than simply talking about them. He warns Apollo that his tiny arrows will conquer the god’s strength (Ovid 1.474 – 1.476), which parallels their situation: Apollo’s pride in his big arrows and brawn will lose against Cupid’s small arrows and intelligence. Although Cupid’s arrow itself does not harm Apollo, its’ affects of (unreciprocated) lust/love for the nymph Daphne certainly impair him. This sort of punishment speaks to the overwhelming and universal nature of love; it affects everybody. As an immortal god there is little that can conquer Apollo, and yet his lust for Daphne completely consumes him. This myth is anomalistic for Greek mythology, as it shows the fallibility of Apollo. He is not only shamed by his ‘defeat’ from Cupid, but he is also at the mercy of Daphne – a woman! This extreme reversal of gender roles is furthered with Daphne’s rejection of Apollo. He is certainly punished for his original arrogance and firmly pushed back to his place in the civilized hierarchy of the gods.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Plato’s *Timaeus* tells of the formation of the world as described in Greek mythology, and in doing so demonstrates the ancient Greek belief that the intertwining of the gods and mortals (both humans and other animals) was deliberately planned and necessary to create a perfect universe. He first asserts that the nature of the gods is nothing humans should occupy themselves with, because “to discover and declare their origin is too great a task for us, and we must trust to those who have declared it aforetime.” This claim stresses the concept that the gods on Olympus are completely removed, physically and spiritually, from the mortals on earth. The gods’ origin is so otherworldly that it could not be directly comprehended by mortals anyway, and so they receive ancestral knowledge from the second-generation, or “children of gods.”
After Timaeus briefly chronicles the succession of the gods from Uranus to Zeus, he quotes the figure believed to have created the eternal universe, professing that the gods must create other beings with a finite lifespan or else “the Heaven will be imperfect; for it will not contain within itself the whole sum of the hinds of living creatures.” While deities and mortals are not of the same consciousness, they are believed to complement each other; the “whole sum” references the world as the ancient Greeks believed, with divinities residing in the clouds and the finite beings occupying solid earth. The one thing they share is the influence of the creation figure, as the gods are instructed to create these creatures by “imitating the power” of this creator in the mold. The idea of an omnipotent creator designing the gods, and in turn the gods constructing all animals with similar attributes to both themselves and the creator, represents a methodical generation and joining of all conscious beings in the universe.
This deliberate connection is elaborated in Timaeus’s continued quote of the creator, who commands that mortals be made from “residue of the previous material” used to create the gods. The rest of their mold is “second and third in degree of purity,” since they are to be endowed with lesser powers than the gods. The ultimate connection between mortals, the gods, and the rest of the universe is conjured in the image of the creator mixing this in the same bowl in which “He had blended and mixed the Soul of the Universe.” The notion that entities of the earth, who are so detached from the divine realm, were created in literally the same place and manner as gods inherently connects the two kinds of beings. Thus gods and mortals were believed to be purposefully made from the same material, but of varying degrees and ingredients, and therefore are separate entities that, together, constitute the essence of the universe.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">The character of Antigone in Sophocles’ Antigone, is one of the few female characters in Greek mythology who rebels against and defies the authority of man, thus breaking the societal expectations of a quiet woman who follows the rules of the men around her. However, her rebellion against human society follows the order of the gods, thus showing the balance between rebellion and order.
Antigone proudly admits that she has rebelled against Creon as she does “declare it and make no denial” (line 442) that she has buried her brother and ignored the rules set by the king. Not only does she ignore the rules of the king, but she also freely admits to it and does not hide from the fact that she has gone against the societal norm. In Greece, Antigone, as a woman, should defer to her husband or father and she should not be proud of her act, so her act is rebellious.
Although Antigone breaks the law set forth by the king and the mortal men around her, she refers to the overwhelming power of Zeus and the gods who truly decide the rules of mortals as a reason for her rebellion(line 450). Antigone clearly is not a wild woman who would break all rules of society, she shows that she is instead a follower to the rules of the gods, who are more important than her fellow mortals. Antigone may rebel against Creon, but she shows humility towards the gods, who are more important. Further, Antigone shows acceptance of her fate to die; although she will become a bride of Hades, Antigone shows that she can recognize that more important than her role in society as a wife and mother, is her role in society as a follower of the order of the gods.
In contrast to Antigone, is Creon who shows extreme hubris against the gods, a more severe crime than Antigone’s defiance of him. As Antigone says, Creon acts as if, “a mortal could override the unwritten and unfailing states given us by the gods” (line 452-455). As he tries to enforce a rule to leave a dead man unburied, which goes agains the proclamations of the gods, he shows hubris because he believes that he has more power than the gods and the ability to change the laws of society and religion.
Antigone’s humility towards the gods and her rebellion towards the king indicate the balance that is necessary to keep order in society. Just as good comes with evil, Antigone shows the humility and hubris that are a necessary part of life in order to keep the order of the universe. Creon on the other hand shows hubris towards the gods, which he is later punished for. Antigone’s death is not a punishment but rather a message to indicate the importance of following the rules and keeping the order set by the gods, even if it means the end of a mortal life.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">Aristophanes’ The Birds is a comedic commentary on the weakness of mankind told via a satiric origin story of the birds. The passage describes mankind as “frail as the foliage of the woods” which is appropriate as Prometheus made man of clay. Neither the playwright or Prometheus myth portray men as mighty or powerful, if anything man’s life “is but darkness.” Despite the passage being so bleak, it is a realistic interpretation for the ancients who genuinely believed that man was frail and subject to the fickle nature of the god. The similarities between the play and outside sources end here. Aristophanes then introduces the birds to the audience in a comedic light. While man is chthonic, the celestial-natured birds are closer to the heavens—a comedic fact that the chorus leader does not want the audience to forget. In Hesiod’s Theogony, Chaos via parthenogenesis creates Gaia and Eros. Anything to come after exists because Eros promotes both parthenogenic and romantic offspring. In The Birds, Chaos, Nyx and Erebus are the only things to exist. Eventually Eros is hatched out of an egg, which helps to elevate the status of the birds. Aristophanes uses this twisted lineage for comedic effect with the idea that the sexual nature of Eros can only happen if Nyx and Erebus exist— the allure of the darkness leads to fornication. The chorus leader attempts to explain with that the birds are created from the union of Chaos and Eros and therefore must be respected. This entire passage is ridden with reminders that Eros, Chaos and Nyx are all winged characters. Aristophanes uses three main points to jokingly emphasize the superiority of the birds; they are children of the gods, they have wings like the gods and the gods hatched out of eggs like they do. The nature of these “facts” are so trivial that Aristophanes uses the line “even Prodicus will envy your knowledge” to highlight the ridiculousness of the birds’ argument. Prodicus was an ancient Greek sophist and as a highly regarded thinker, to whom even Plato paid his respects. This line is a light-hearted way of addressing the audience; what they’ve learned about the birds is a hidden truth that makes the audience wiser than Prodicus. Despite the comedic explanation about the birds, the fact that they are indeed unchained to the earth unlike chthonic men, making them able to ascend closer to the heavens to be closer to the immortals Olympians. This is a grim and comedic reminder that man is so weak and frail. Men are mere byproducts of Prometheus and Epimetheus’ meddling whereas the birds are fruitful offspring of the great Chaos and Eros. The passage starts with the frail nature of mankind, introduces and mocks the superiority of birds, and ends with a reminder that the birds may not be demigods but they’re closer to heavens than the common man ever would be.</chars>

This passage from the Homeric Hymn to Dionysus draws attention primarily to Dionysus&apos; role as a powerful entity of disorder and a crosser of boundaries. He first appears as an adolescent &quot;by the shore of the fruitless sea&quot;, which is a relatively tame double-reinforcement of Dionysus&apos; status as a crosser of boundaries. Not only does he appear to be at the brink of manhood - existing between the bounds of child and adult - but he is standing at the edge of the sea: one of the ultimate boundaries between the mortal and divine spheres. His fashion choices are appropriately contrarian, a &quot;purple robe&quot; and &quot;dark hair [...] waving about him&quot;, present him as a luxuriously indulgent foreigner with a bit of a feminine affectation, which vividly juxtaposes with his &quot;strong shoulders&quot; and other masculine descriptors. Indeed, the pirates he encounters believe him to be the pampered prince of a distant kingdom; traveling around lands where he has no business being.
This disregard for - or conscious opposition to - established borders is one of the key sentiments at the heart of Dionysus&apos; brand of unrest. He is the only Olympian with a mortal parent; his very godhood blurs the line between the earthly and heavenly realms.
In this story Dionysus&apos; comic dramatic nature is revealed as well. When the god begins to enact revenge on his would-be kidnappers, the chaos that ensues is nothing short of silly. Suddenly there&apos;s a lion on the ship, vines are growing out of the mast, and men are jumping into the sea and being turned into dolphins. Then, suddenly, the theatrics end and Dionysus introduces himself to his first follower. The abrupt switches from Dionysus sitting &quot;with a smile in his dark eyes&quot; to his hilariously terrifying retributive outburst and then back again to amiably introducing himself to the helmsman are so extreme, it seems as though Dionysus can traverse the borders of sanity and rage as easily as one would turn a light on and off.
Dionysus is one beyond the boundaries of order. He allows mortals to transcend the mundane world and become more in touch with the divine will through his cultic rituals and the consumption of alcohol, and is worshipped outside the civilizing reaches of the cities. Dionysus can be depicted bearded or as a smooth-faced youth, masculine or androgynous. He even exists in a constant cycle of death and rebirth, traveling to and from Hades with the passing seasons. Dionysus does not embody contradictions as much as he just goes wherever he pleases, paying no mind to the lines that divide the world or deliberately crossing them with ease.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">This myth demonstrates the substantial and acute presence of the gods in the life of Ancient Greeks. Their expansive presence is highlighted when this myth is compared with the story of Abraham and Isaac in the Old Testament, with which this story has strong associations. In both, a deity asks a devotee to do the unthinkable, and murder their child. This is the ultimate test of devotion to a higher power. Children are supposed to be what a parent values most, and this was especially true in ancient times when the continuation of family lineage held so much significance. Abraham and Agamemnon are not only being asked to kill a loved one, they are also forced to eliminate one of their chances to continue the family line. This request demonstrates the universal power of the gods of Ancient Greece, and the God of Biblical times. Artemis holds full sway over Agamemnon; though he regrets what must be done, he does not think twice about deceiving his daughter and murdering her. For Greeks and Biblical persons alike the word of a deity was law.
These two sacrificial stories diverge at a crucial moment, however. While God spares Isaac at the last second and allows him to return home with his father, Artemis takes Iphigenia for her own. Though she starts a new life in Taurus, to her family, Iphigenia is as good as dead. In the Old Testament, God tells Abraham to sacrifice his son as a test of faith, and once that faith is assured, he spares the boy. Artemis demands Iphigenia’s life as just compensation for a broken promise. This reveals a major contrast between the Greek gods and the God of the Old Testament. The God of the Judeo-Christian religions keeps order through benevolence. His believers know he is capable of cruel justice, but because of this knowledge and subsequent fear, He usually has no need to act on it. On the other hand, the Greek gods are very active in their justice. Artemis does not hesitate to take a child from her parents, or hold up an entire fleet of ships as a punishment for being denied what is rightfully hers.
The goddess allocates justice as she sees fit. In this version of the myth Artemis spares Iphigenia from death, deciding that she would rather have her as a priestess, yet Agamemnon and his family are punished nonetheless. The Greeks’ harsher outlook on their relationship with their gods illustrates their differing conception of the world from those who follow the Judeo-Christian religions. The Old Testament indicates that if men follow the word of God, God will have no need to interfere negatively in their lives, but the Greeks believed that gods often involved themselves in human lives to allot punishment where it was merited.

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">In the hymn to Dionysus Homer uses Dionysian symbols along with examples of duality to illustrate the complicated nature of the god, Dionysus. The first piece of evidence of Dionysus’ specific godly qualities occurs when “a vine spread out both ways along the top of the sail” and “fragrant wine” begins to flow from essentially everywhere. Homer uses this imagery to identify Dionysus because he is the god vegetation, in particular wine. The second indicator of his specific qualities lies in the fact that Dionysus “changed into a dreadful lion”. This occurrence is very specific to him for two separate reasons. The first reason lies in one of the popular epithets that comes before his name. Dionysus is often described by “bromios” or “the roarer”. In the animal kingdom the lion is also known for its powerful and earth shaking roar. By depicting Dionysus as a lion, Homer reinforces his epithet in an underlying manner. Transforming into an animal is also indicative of Dionysus because he represents the bestial qualities of life. Few things could be considered more bestial than changing into a lion and attacking a ship full of sailors.
The most important quality that is attributed to Dionysus is that he represents being one thing and its opposite. This idea is displayed quite clearly throughout the myth in various ways. The helmsman is the only person who recognizes Dionysus as he asks, “what god is this whom you have taken and bind…?” and then beseeches the men to release the god. Dionysus is known to be kind to those who accept him which gained him the epithet “polygethes” or “giver of much joy,” and he stays true to this title as he rewards the helmsman for recognizing him, making the man “altogether happy.” We see Dionysus take an altogether different approach towards the sailors who captured him and denied his divinity. Along with being the bringer of joy, Dionysus is known to bring despair upon those who reject him. The sailors believe he is a wealthy man who will, “speak out and tell us his friends and all his wealth and his brothers”. In return Dionysus releases a bear upon the men, murders the captain, and transforms the other men into dolphins. This vengeful and murderous depiction of Dionysus is a direct opposite of the kind and generous god we see speak to the helmsman. Another illustration of Dionysus’s duality occurs when Homer describes Dionysus’ demeanor while the sailors attempt to tie him up. Homer writes that Dionysus sat with a, “smile in his dark eyes”. While it can be interpreted that Dionysus simply had dark colored eyes it can also be interpreted in a more complicated manner. The line seems to illustrate that while Dionysus looked happy on the surface there was rage in his eyes. These two examples of Dionysus’ complex and dual nature, along with Homer’s use of Dionysian imagery creates a myth that illustrates the god’s qualities extremely well.

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">In the Homeric Hymn to Dionysus, pirates mistake Dionysius for the son of a wealthy king and take him on their ship. All pirates, except one, pay the price for this mistake. The hymn portrays Dionysius’ overwhelming power and the essential characteristics of his worship: wine, vine, bestial transformations, death to his enemies and salvation for those who accept and submit to him.
The poem is a clear depiction of Dionysius’ power and grandeur. When the pirates attempt to “bind him with rude bonds…the binds would not hold him” (The Homeric Hymns, Hymn 7, 10). Dionysius is a very powerful god, after all he is the son of Zeus. Zeus sewed Dionysius to his own thighs to be born again after he had killed Dionysius’ mother, Semele. The fact that Dionysius was born out of the most potent of all Gods explains his overwhelming power.
Dionysius is the god of grapes (wine), and vine. At sea, Dionysius begins to manifest his power in the form of elements of his worship. He makes “fragrant wine [run] streaming throughout all the black ship” leaving the sailors in awe, overwhelmed by his power”(35). The altered state of consciousness that comes with inebriation is essential to Dionysius’ worship. He is something foreign that overwhelms the worshipper, similar to the effect of alcohol on the brain. He asserted his identity with the vine which is another characteristic of his worship, “a vine spread out both ways along the top of the sail.(35)” Dionysius is also worshiped for fertile lands, the sea is first described as “fruitless”(10) and after Dionysius comes forth, the mast is seen “blossoming with flowers, and with rich berries growing on it (40).”
One of Dionysius’ epithets is bromios, the Roarer, which is represented by his transformation into “a dreadful lion”, a very powerful, ruthless creature. The lion, like Dionysius, has a power that is overwhelming and irresistible. Dionysius also creates a bear and transforms the sailors into dolphins. Bestial transformations are common in myths involving Dionysius. These represent the bestial side of his power, one of the extremes of his worship. Within Dionysius lies both the bestial and the sublime.
A common theme in Dionysius’ worship is evident in the poem. The Roarer brings happiness and salvation to those who submit to his power and worship him, and madness and death to those who do not. He brings salvation and joy to the “right-minded helmsman” (45) who had acknowledged his power and respected him. However, all the other sailors who had gone against him, lose their minds and are transformed into animals. Dionysius is the god of the extremes and the opposites. He can bring sublime happiness, and horrendous destruction.
The dual and contradicting nature of Dionysius’ power, his overwhelming effect over mortals and the essential characteristics of his worship, wine and vine in particular, are all depicted in the Homeric Hymn to Dionysius.</chars>

        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">A dark background sets the scene for this elaborate portrayal of the underworld – a sign that the Greeks associated this place with the dark, the dead and the condemned. The vase is strategically divided into three levels, constructed in such a way to correspond to the separated depths of the underworld. Nemesis resides on the highest level of the vase representing the spirit of divine retribution against the convicted who succumb to hubris. She ensures that when one defies society’s law, their equal right is seized from them. Her placement on the vase is less than mere coincidence as retribution played a key theme in ancient Greek society.
The middle section contains Hades and Persephone, the judges and charming Orpheus. Hades and Persephone occupy the centre of the vase, enclosed within a light palace to depict their importance, power and to enforce the idea that the underworld could not function without their presences’. To the left, Orpheus is depicted on the same plane as Hades and Persephone as he attempts to enchant them with his lyre in order to retrieve his wife from the underworld. To the right, the judges are depicted at the trivium sacred to Hecate, consulting one another, presumably about the fate of a soul. Hades, Persephone and the three judges appear on the same level as the underworld revolves around their roles as overseers, and their judgements.
On the lowest level of the vase, which represents Tartarus, Tantalus and Sisyphus appear on the edges. Both are men condemned to eternal punishment within Tartarus. Tantalus is portrayed forever-grasping at the unattainable fruit and water and Sisyphus is depicted, with all his strength, attempting to push the rock up a hill as Fury is whipping him. This clearly shows that eternal punishments were administered and looked upon with no mercy. In this case, Fury has snakes for hair, which potentially reflects the evil and relentlessness of Medusa, who also could show no mercy to all those who looked upon her and were turned to stone. Next to Fury, appears Hermes, who seems to be helping Hercules in his last Labour to capture Cerberus from Tartarus. They have been specifically placed by the side of Hecate, one of the chief goddesses of the Eleusinian Mysteries, as before Hercules was able to capture Cerberus, he had to be initiated in the Eleusinian Mysteries so as he could acquire the knowledge of passing into and out of the underworld alive.
The vase itself displays a deeper concept that defined Ancient Greek culture - the belief that the end of one’s life, whether their fate be fortuitous or not, resulted in a lasting existence in Hades. It aptly depicts the occurrences and crucial characters present in the underworld, and specifically Tantalus and Sisyphus serve to caution Greeks of eternal struggles faced by the condemned confined in Tartarus. This idea was upheld by society with the upmost severity from fear of eternal pain and suffering that awaited any wrongdoer.</chars>
